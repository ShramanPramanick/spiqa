For example, we can calculate the word importance and contribution matrix of each word in a sentence pair. The word importance indicates the importance of a word in the sentence, and the contribution matrix shows how each word in the source sentence contributes to the generation of each word in the target sentence. We can then use these measures to identify the words that are under-translated.'}", "all_figures_names": ["11-Table6-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
