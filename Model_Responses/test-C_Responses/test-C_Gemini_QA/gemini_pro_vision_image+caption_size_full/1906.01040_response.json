For example, if someone is mouthing the word \"ba\" but you hear the sound \"ga\", you might perceive the word as \"da\". This happens because the brain is trying to make sense of the sensory information it is receiving, and it will often fill in gaps or make changes to the information in order to make it more consistent. In the case of the McGurk effect, the brain is trying to make sense of the mismatch between the visual information (the mouth movements) and the auditory information (the sound of the word), and it does this by creating a new percept that is a combination of the two.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "8-Table7-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "When the perception of what we hear is influenced by what we see."}}
