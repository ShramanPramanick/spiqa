The method uses a gated mechanism to integrate three different embeddings from: 1) conversational-context, 2) previous word, 3) current speech.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer."}}
