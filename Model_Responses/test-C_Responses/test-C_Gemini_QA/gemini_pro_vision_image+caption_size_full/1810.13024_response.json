It is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which the nodes represent the possible output words and the arcs represent the transitions between the words. The arcs are typically weighted with probabilities, which indicate the likelihood of the transition. The confusion network or lattice can be used to find the most likely output hypothesis by finding the path through the graph with the highest probability.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
