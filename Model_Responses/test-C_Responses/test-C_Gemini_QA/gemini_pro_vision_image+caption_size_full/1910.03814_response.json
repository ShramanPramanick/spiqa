For example, in the case of hate speech detection, multimodal models can use both the text and image content to make a more informed decision. This can be seen in the results, where the multimodal models achieve higher accuracy than the unimodal models.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure6-1.png", "7-Figure7-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Figure6-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Unimodal LSTM vs Best Multimodal (FCM)\n- F score: 0.703 vs 0.704\n- AUC: 0.732 vs 0.734 \n- Mean Accuracy: 68.3 vs 68.4 "}}
