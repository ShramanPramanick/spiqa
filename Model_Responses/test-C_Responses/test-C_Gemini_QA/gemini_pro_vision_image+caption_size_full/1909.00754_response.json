The model is able to achieve good performance on the MultiWoZ test set, which shows that the model is able to generalize to new domains. However, the model is not able to achieve as good performance on the WoZ 2.0 test set, which is a single-domain dataset. This shows that the model is not able to generalize as well to new domains as it is to multi-domain datasets.\nThe reason for this is likely due to the fact that the model is trained on a multi-domain dataset, which means that it is exposed to a wider variety of data. This allows the model to learn more generalizable representations of the data, which makes it better able to handle new domains.", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure4-1.png", "9-Figure5-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "single-domain setting"}}
