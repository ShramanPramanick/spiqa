{"802": {"question": "How strong is the correlation between the prevalence of the #MeToo movement and official reports [of sexual harassment]?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": " {'Answer': 'Based on Figure 1, there is no direct correlation between the prevalence of the #MeToo movement and official reports of sexual harassment. However, according to Table 2, there is a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of normalized cases and sexual harassment. This means that as the number of normalized cases increases, so does the number of sexual harassment cases. Additionally, according to Table 3, there is a statistically significant positive correlation between the third-party physical harassment sentiment and the third-party affected sentiment. This means that as the third-party physical harassment sentiment increases, so does the third-party affected sentiment. This suggests that there may be a relationship between the prevalence of the #MeToo movement and an increase in the number of sexual harassment cases and the affected sentiment. However, more research is needed to determine the exact nature of this relationship.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "0.9098 correlation"}, "805": {"question": "Which geographical regions correlate to the trend?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": " {'Answer': 'The Northeast, West, and South regions correlate to the trend.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Northeast U.S., West U.S. and South U.S."}}
