As shown in Table 3, when fixing the selection mask, the Self-Bleu score of VRS is higher than that of SS, which means that VRS has better controllability of content selection. At the same time, the performance of VRS is also better than that of SS, which means that VRS does not necessarily drop the performance when more control is desired.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "15-Table7-1.png", "8-Table6-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "14-Figure5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table5-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
