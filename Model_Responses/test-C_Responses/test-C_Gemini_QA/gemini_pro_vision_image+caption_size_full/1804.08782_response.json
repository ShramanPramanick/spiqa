{"1009": {"question": "How do they correlate NED with emotional bond levels?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": " {'Answer': 'NED correlates with emotional bond levels through a learned mapping between the acoustic features of speech and the emotional state of the speaker. This mapping is learned through a deep neural network (DNN) that is trained on a dataset of labeled speech. The DNN is able to learn the relationship between the acoustic features of speech and the emotional state of the speaker by identifying patterns in the data. Once the DNN is trained, it can be used to predict the emotional state of a speaker based on the acoustic features of their speech.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "They compute Pearson\u2019s correlation between NED measure for patient-to-therapist and patient-perceived emotional bond rating and NED measure for therapist-to-patient and patient-perceived emotional bond rating"}}
