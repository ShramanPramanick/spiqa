When the visual grounding is removed, the performance of the model drops significantly. This indicates that the visual grounding helps the model to learn more discriminative and generalizable representations.'}", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "performance is significantly degraded without pixel data"}}
