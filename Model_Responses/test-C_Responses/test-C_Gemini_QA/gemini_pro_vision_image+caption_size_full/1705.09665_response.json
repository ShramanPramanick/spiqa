For example, in distinctive communities, the language used is more likely to be specific to that community and less likely to be used in other communities. In dynamic communities, the language used is more likely to change over time. In consistent communities, the language used is more likely to remain the same over time.'}", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
