In the original softmax, the decision boundary is a linear hyperplane that separates the two classes. In AM-Softmax, the decision boundary is a curved hyperplane that has a fixed margin around the data points.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "4-TableI-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
