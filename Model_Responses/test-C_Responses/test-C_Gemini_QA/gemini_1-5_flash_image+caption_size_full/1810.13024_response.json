{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Answer': 'A confusion network (CN) is a representation of the possible word sequences that can be recognized by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. It is a graph where each node represents a word and each edge represents a possible transition between words. The CN represents the set of all possible word sequences that could be recognized by the ASR system, with their corresponding probabilities.  A lattice is a similar representation, but it can be more compact and represent the possible word sequences with their corresponding probabilities. It is typically used for speech recognition and translation tasks. Both CNs and lattices are used in ASR systems to improve the accuracy of speech recognition by allowing the system to consider multiple possible word sequences. However, they are also more computationally expensive to process than traditional one-best sequences.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
