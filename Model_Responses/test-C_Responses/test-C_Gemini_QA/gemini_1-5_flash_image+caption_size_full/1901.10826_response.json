The left side shows the decision boundary for the original Softmax, while the right side shows the decision boundary for AM-Softmax.  The figure shows that the AM-Softmax classifier introduces a margin between different classes in the feature space. This margin helps to improve the performance of the classifier, especially when there are many classes or when the data is highly overlapping.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-TableI-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
