{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Answer': 'The most typical GAN architecture is composed of a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator is trained to generate images that look realistic, and the Discriminator is trained to tell the difference between real and generated images. These networks are trained in an adversarial manner, where the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator by producing more realistic images, and the Discriminator tries to improve its ability to detect fake images. This iterative training process leads to the Generator producing increasingly realistic images. Different GANs, such as GAN-INT-CLS, StackGAN, StackGAN++, AttnGAN, and HDGAN, use this basic architecture with different modifications and refinements to achieve better performance, such as higher resolution or better semantic consistency between the generated image and the text input.'}", "all_figures_names": ["22-Figure12-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
