It uses Beta-Binomial distribution to generate different training data distributions. The paper does not compare the performance on unseen data, but it analyzes how different training lengths and hidden unit sizes impact the generalization performance within the training data itself. Therefore, the answer is not available.'}", "all_figures_names": ["10-Figure6-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png", "5-Figure1-1.png", "9-Figure5-1.png", "10-Figure7-1.png", "8-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
