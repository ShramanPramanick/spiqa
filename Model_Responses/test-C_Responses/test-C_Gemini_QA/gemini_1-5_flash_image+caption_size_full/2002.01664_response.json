The approach utilizes the NetVLAD layer and replaces the conventional spatial pooling with a ghost vector which is a learned vector of size KxD.  In experiments, GhostVLAD outperforms other methods like i-vector + svm, TDNN + stat-pool and LSTM + stat-pool with a F1-Score of 98.43%. It also achieves better performance than other pooling methods like average pooling, statistics pooling, and NetVLAD pooling.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content."}, "100": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "{'Answer': 'The 7 Indian languages that they experiment with are Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, and Malayalam.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam"}, "101": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Answer': 'Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali,  English and Assamese (in table, missing in text)"}}
