The authors show that communities with distinctive language and dynamic discussions, like those about sports teams or current events, tend to have higher user retention rates compared to more consistent communities like those about advice or entertainment. They also find that the size of the acculturation gap, which measures the difference in language use between established members and outsiders, varies systematically according to the community\u2019s distinctiveness and dynamicity. For example, distinctive communities like those about sports teams or specific interests, tend to have larger acculturation gaps. This suggests that the language used in these communities plays a more important role in establishing identity and belonging than in more generic communities. Overall, the study highlights the important role that language plays in shaping the social dynamics of online communities.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
