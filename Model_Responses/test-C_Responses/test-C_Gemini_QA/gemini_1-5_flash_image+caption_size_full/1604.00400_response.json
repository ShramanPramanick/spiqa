These correlations vary depending on the variant of ROUGE (F-Score, Recall, Precision) and the variant of SERA (DIS, KW, NP) and the cut-off point of SERA. The correlations are higher when the variants of ROUGE and SERA are similar, such as ROUGE-2-F and SERA-KW-5, which have a high correlation with each other.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
