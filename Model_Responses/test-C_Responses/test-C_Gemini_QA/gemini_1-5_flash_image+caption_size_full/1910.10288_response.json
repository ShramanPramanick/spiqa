For the Lessac dataset, GMMv2 + Bias performs the best, while DCA performs the best for the LJ dataset. Therefore, there is no clear winner between DCA and GMM-based attention, as both perform well depending on the dataset.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "2-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "About the same performance"}}
