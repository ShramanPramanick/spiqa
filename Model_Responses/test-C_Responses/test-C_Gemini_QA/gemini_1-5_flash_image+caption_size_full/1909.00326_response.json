For example, they use attribution methods that measure the importance of words in the source language, and then compare that importance with the word count in the target language. The paper then compares the results of the different methods, showing which ones are most effective at identifying under-translated words. The results show that the attribution method is the most effective at identifying under-translated words.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure4-1.png", "11-Table5-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
