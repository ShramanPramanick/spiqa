The table highlights the different lexemes used to express different relationships, depending on the frequency of their occurrence. For example, lexemes like \u201cviable\u201d, \u201ccontributed\u201d, \u201c60th\u201d, \u201ctouched\u201d, and \u201cPalestinians\u201d are more likely to be used when expressing the SOLUTIONHOOD relationship when the frequency is above 0. On the other hand, lexemes like \u201cWhat\u201d, \u201cWhy\u201d, \u201cdid\u201d, and \u201cHow\u201d are more likely to be used when expressing the same relationship when the frequency is above 10.
