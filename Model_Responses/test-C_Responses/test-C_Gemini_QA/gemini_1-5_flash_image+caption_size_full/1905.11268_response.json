The system will then use a different model to recognize the word. These models include a neutral, pass-through, and background model. The best performing backoff strategy is the background model, which uses a large corpus of data to recognize words. This strategy is shown to have the lowest sensitivity value, as well as having the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) on a smaller, domain-specific dataset (See figure 2).

They work by combining a foreground model, trained on a smaller, domain-specific dataset, with a background model, trained on a larger, more general dataset. The foreground model is used to recognize words that are in the specific domain, while the background model is used to recognize words that are not in the domain.
