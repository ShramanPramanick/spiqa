However, it's important to note that this may not hold true as research progresses and new models are developed. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "No, supervised models perform better for this task."}}
