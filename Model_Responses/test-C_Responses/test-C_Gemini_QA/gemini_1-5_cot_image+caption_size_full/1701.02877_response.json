{"301": {"question": "What web and user-generated NER datasets are used for the analysis?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'This table lists multiple web and user-generated NER datasets such as ACE WL and OntoNotes WB.'}\nThe answer is : The image and caption do not specify what datasets were used for the analysis. However, the caption does state that the table presents results for Named Entity Recognition with different models evaluated on different testing corpora.  Some web and user-generated NER datasets used for this evaluation include ACE WL and OntoNotes WB. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "18-Table14-1.png", "14-Table12-1.png", "12-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "13-Table11-1.png", "8-Table7-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "MUC, CoNLL, ACE, OntoNotes, MSM, Ritter, UMBC"}}
