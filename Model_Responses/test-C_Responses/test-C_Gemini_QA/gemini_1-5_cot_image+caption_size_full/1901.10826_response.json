It displays how the decision boundary changes with the incorporation of a fixed margin in AM-Softmax, leading to better class separation. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-TableI-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
