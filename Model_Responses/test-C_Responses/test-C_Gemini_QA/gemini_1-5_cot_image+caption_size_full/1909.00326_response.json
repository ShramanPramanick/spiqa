It simply shows the accuracy of different methods for detecting such errors based on estimated word importance. \n", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "11-Table6-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
