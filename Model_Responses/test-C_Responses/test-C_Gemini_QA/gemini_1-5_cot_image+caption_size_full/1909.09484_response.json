{"720": {"question": "How much is proposed model better than baselines in performed experiments?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'It includes quantitive results for different models on DSTC2 and Maluuba datasets.'}\nThe answer is : The proposed model (GDP+RL) shows improvements in BLEU scores compared to E2ECM and CDM models (both with and without RL) in both DSTC2 and Maluuba datasets. For example, in DSTC2, GDP+RL achieves a BLEU score of 0.2879, while E2ECM+RL and CDM+RL achieve 0.1823 and 0.2888 respectively. In Maluuba, GDP+RL scores 0.1226, compared to 0.0709 for E2ECM+RL and 0.0734 for CDM+RL. \n", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "most of the models have similar performance on BPRA: DSTC2 (+0.0015), Maluuba (+0.0729)\nGDP achieves the best performance in APRA: DSTC2 (+0.2893), Maluuba (+0.2896)\nGDP significantly outperforms the baselines on BLEU: DSTC2 (+0.0791), Maluuba (+0.0492)"}}
