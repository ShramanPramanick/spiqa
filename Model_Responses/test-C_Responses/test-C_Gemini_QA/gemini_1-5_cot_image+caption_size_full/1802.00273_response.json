{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 shows how a single multilingual NMT model can be trained to translate multiple language pairs, even for language pairs not explicitly seen during training (zero-shot translation).'} \n\nThe answer is : **Neural machine translation (NMT) models can learn cross-lingual representations through transfer learning. By training on a diverse dataset of multiple language pairs, these models can develop a shared embedding space where similar concepts are clustered together, regardless of the language. This allows them to generalize to unseen language pairs, enabling zero-shot translation.** \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
