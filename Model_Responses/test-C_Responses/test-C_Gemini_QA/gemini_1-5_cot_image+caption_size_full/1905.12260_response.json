{"1249": {"question": "How much important is the visual grounding in the learning of the multilingual representations?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Image 2 is a table showing multilingual document classification accuracy with and without visual grounding (ImageVec Baseline vs other ImageVec).'}\nThe answer is : Visual grounding is important for learning multilingual representations. ImageVec, when trained with visual grounding, achieves higher accuracy in multilingual document classification compared to the baseline ImageVec without visual grounding. \n", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "performance is significantly degraded without pixel data"}}
