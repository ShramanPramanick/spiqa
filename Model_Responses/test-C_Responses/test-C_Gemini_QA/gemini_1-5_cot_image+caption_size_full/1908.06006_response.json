The best scores are in bold and those better than the baseline HAN model are marked with a \u2020.  Several models, particularly variants of CAHAN-SUM, outperform HAN on the Amazon, Yelp, and Yahoo datasets. \n", "all_figures_names": ["1-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
