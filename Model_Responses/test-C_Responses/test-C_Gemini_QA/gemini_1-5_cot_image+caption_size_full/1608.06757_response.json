{"296": {"question": "what is the state of the art?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Image 3 shows the F1 scores of various methods on multiple datasets. State-of-the-art usually refers to the best-performing methods.'} \nThe answer is : Based on the provided table, the Stanford NER system with CRF + Distinguish features achieves the highest F1 score of 99.5 on the CoNLL2003 dataset and 94.8 on the KORE50 dataset for Named Entity Recognition in common English news texts, making it a strong candidate for the state-of-the-art at the time of this research. However, context is needed to ascertain if these results still hold true. \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Babelfy, DBpedia Spotlight, Entityclassifier.eu, FOX, LingPipe MUC-7, NERD-ML, Stanford NER, TagMe 2"}}
