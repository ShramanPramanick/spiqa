These styles influence the model's word choices and how it combines information from the source. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "well-formed sentences vs concise answers"}, "458": {"question": "Is there exactly one \"answer style\" per dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [7], "response": "{'Image': 7, 'Rationale': 'This image describes the \"NLG\" and \"ANS\" subsets of the MS MARCO dataset, which indicates different answer styles.'}\nThe answer is : No, a dataset can contain multiple answer styles, as evidenced by the \"NLG\" and \"ANS\" subsets within the MS MARCO dataset. \n", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "459": {"question": "What are the baselines that Masque is compared against?", "referred_figures_indices": [6, 0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 is a table that compares the performance of \"Masque\" against other models (baselines) on the NarrativeQA dataset.'}\nThe answer is : The baselines that Masque is compared against are BiDAF, DECAPROP, MHPGM+NOIC, ConZNet, and RMR+A2D. \n", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table5-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png"], "answer": "BiDAF, Deep Cascade QA, S-Net+CES2S, BERT+Multi-PGNet, Selector+CCG, VNET, DECAPROP, MHPGM+NOIC, ConZNet, RMR+A2D"}, "460": {"question": "What is the performance achieved on NarrativeQA?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "```json\n{\n 'Image': 5,\n 'Rationale': 'Image 5 contains a table that shows the performance of different models on the NarrativeQA dataset.'\n}\n```\nThe answer is : The highest performance achieved on NarrativeQA, as shown in Table 5, is 59.87 in R-L. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table5-1.png"], "answer": "Bleu-1: 54.11, Bleu-4: 30.43, METEOR: 26.13, ROUGE-L: 59.87"}, "461": {"question": "What is an \"answer style\"?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'The caption explicitly mentions \"answer style\" and distinguishes between Q\\&A and NLG styles.'} \nThe answer is : An \"answer style\" refers to the format or manner in which an answer is presented.
