During those prompts, the user can either try to rephrase or provide more information, which is then used to update the information dictionary (ID).  \n", "all_figures_names": ["13-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png", "9-Table11-1.png", "9-Table10-1.png", "12-Table18-1.png", "9-Table8-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "It defined a sequence labeling task to extract custom entities from user input and label the next action (out of 13  custom actions defined)."}}
