{"1504": {"question": "How much is the gap between using the proposed objective and using only cross-entropy objective?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This image shows the training curve of DCN+ with and without reinforcement learning, where the latter uses only the cross-entropy objective.'}\nThe answer is : The figure depicts that the model using only cross-entropy objective initially performs better. However, the proposed objective, which starts policy learning from scratch, quickly outperforms the cross entropy model. It's difficult to quantify the exact gap without specific numbers on the y-axis. \n", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "The mixed objective improves EM by 2.5% and F1 by 2.2%"}}
