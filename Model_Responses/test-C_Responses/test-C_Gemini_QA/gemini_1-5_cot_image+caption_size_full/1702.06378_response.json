{"201": {"question": "Can SCRF be used to pretrain the model?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'It explicitly mentions CTC pretraining which is very related to the question.'}\nThe answer is : Yes, the model can be pretrained using CTC. As shown in Figure 1, using CTC pretraining helps the model to converge faster and achieve better performance compared to random initialization. \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
