While Image 1 shows examples of tweets, it is not possible to determine from the given data whether all instances contain code-switching. \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Table3-1.png", "2-Table2-1.png", "2-Table4-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["1-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}, "879": {"question": "Do they perform some annotation?", "referred_figures_indices": [0, 3, 4], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'This image shows examples of tweets and their corresponding translations, which might suggest a form of annotation.'}\nThe answer is : This research paper does not explicitly mention performing any specific annotation tasks.
