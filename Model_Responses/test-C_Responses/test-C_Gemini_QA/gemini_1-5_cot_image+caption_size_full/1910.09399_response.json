{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "```json\n{\n 'Image': 5,\n 'Rationale': 'Image 5 shows the detailed architectures of five common text-to-image GAN networks, making it the most relevant for answering the question.'\n}\n```\nThe answer is : **Image 5 showcases the detailed architectures of five prominent GAN networks used in text-to-image synthesis, including Conditional GAN (cGAN), Manifold Interpolation Matching-Aware Discriminator GAN (GAN-INT-CLS), Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), Text Conditioned Auxiliary Classifier GAN (TAC-GAN), and Text Conditioned Semantic Classifier GAN (Text-SeGAN). Each architecture is accompanied by a brief explanation of how text input is utilized for image generation.** \n", "all_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "8-Figure6-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "20-Table2-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "18-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
