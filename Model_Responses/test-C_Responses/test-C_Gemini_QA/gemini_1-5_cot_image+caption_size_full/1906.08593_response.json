{"104": {"question": "Which neural architecture do they use as a base for their attention conflict mechanisms?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This image showcases the generic model used, which can incorporate attention, conflict, or both mechanisms.'}\nThe answer is : The provided text does not specify which neural architecture is used as a base for the attention conflict mechanisms. However, Figure 3 indicates the model utilizes GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) for context encoding before the interaction layer. \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "GRU-based encoder, interaction block, and classifier consisting of stacked fully-connected layers."}}
