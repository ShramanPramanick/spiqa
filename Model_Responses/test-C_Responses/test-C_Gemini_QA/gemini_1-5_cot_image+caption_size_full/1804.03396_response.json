{"636": {"question": "Can this approach model n-ary relations?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 6, 'Rationale': 'This table shows that this model can work on datasets with sequential outputs, meaning the relations are not limited to binary.'}\nThe answer is : This approach can model n-ary relations because it is capable of working on datasets with sequential outputs, such as the SEQ datasets described in Table 4. This means the relations are not limited to binary relations. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure2-1.png", "11-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "9-Table3-1.png", "14-Table8-1.png", "10-Table4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
