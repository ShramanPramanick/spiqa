It's highly likely that word order is important in \"car speak language\" if it refers to how people discuss cars. \n", "all_figures_names": ["1-Figure1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}, "410": {"question": "What is the performance of classifiers?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "```json\n{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 lists common evaluation metrics for classifiers.'}\n```\nThe answer is : The performance of classifiers can be measured with evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using F1 Micro measure, the KNN classifier perform 0.6762, the RF 0.6687, SVM 0.6712 and MLP 0.6778."}, "411": {"question": "What classifiers have been trained?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This table lists the different classifiers by name: KNN, RF, SVM, MLP.'}\nThe answer is : KNN, RF, SVM, and MLP have been trained. \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "KNN\nRF\nSVM\nMLP"}}
