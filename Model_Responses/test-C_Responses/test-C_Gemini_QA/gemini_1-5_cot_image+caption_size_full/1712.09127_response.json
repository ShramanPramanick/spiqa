{"46": {"question": "Do they evaluate grammaticality of generated text?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'This image shows example output from both original text and text from a deGAN model, showing that the model may not prioritize grammatical correctness.'}\nThe answer is : Although this paper does not evaluate on grammaticality directly, we can infer that it may not be a high priority for the deGAN model based on the example output text provided in Table 4. Some of the generated text lacks articles or proper verb conjugation, indicating that grammaticality is not a primary focus of the model. \n", "all_figures_names": ["12-Table6-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png", "14-Table9-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "13-Table7-1.png", "11-Table3-1.png", "10-Table1-1.png", "11-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["10-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
