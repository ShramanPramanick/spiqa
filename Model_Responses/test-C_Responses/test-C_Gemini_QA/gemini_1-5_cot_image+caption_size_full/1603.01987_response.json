{"259": {"question": "Is it valid to presume a bad medical wikipedia article should not contain much domain-specific jargon?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 'None', 'Rationale': 'None of the images are helpful for answering the question.'}\nThe answer is : No, it is not valid to presume that a bad medical Wikipedia article should not contain much domain-specific jargon. While excessive jargon can make an article difficult to understand for the average reader, the presence or absence of jargon alone is not a reliable indicator of an article's quality.  A bad article can still contain simple language and a good article may require technical terms for accuracy and completeness. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "13-Table5-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "10-Table3-1.png", "12-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "11-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
