However, as both methods can be used with the same data representation (Doc2Vec or Seq2Seq), it is likely that the distance metric depends on the chosen data representation, not the clustering method itself. \n", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
