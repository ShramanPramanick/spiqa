This information is crucial to determine if the graph representation is supervised or not.'\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is : Based on the architecture of G-BERT described in Figure 2, the graph representation is **supervised**.  The model uses ontology embedding, which incorporates information from the ontology structure (like ICD9 and ATC) to represent medical codes. This embedding, along with the input data, is fed into a BERT model, and the entire system is fine-tuned for the medication recommendation task. This end-to-end training with labeled data implies that the graph representation learning is supervised. \n", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "The graph representation appears to be semi-supervised.
