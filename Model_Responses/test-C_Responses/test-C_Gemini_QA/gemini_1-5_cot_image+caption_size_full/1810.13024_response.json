{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'This image shows examples of a confusion network.'}\nThe answer is : A confusion network, also called a lattice, is a graph representation used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) that expands upon the one-best output by including multiple possible word hypotheses along with their probabilities or scores. It captures the uncertainty of the speech recognition process by representing alternative word sequences and their corresponding likelihoods, unlike a simple sequence which only provides the single most likely word sequence. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
