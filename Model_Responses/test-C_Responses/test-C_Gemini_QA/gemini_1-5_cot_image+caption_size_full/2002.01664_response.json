As depicted in Image 4, GhostVLAD, positioned on the right side, employs fewer clusters (denoted by circles) compared to NetVLAD on the left. This reduction in clusters effectively minimizes the number of computations required. Consequently, GhostVLAD achieves a more computationally efficient approach while maintaining comparable or even superior performance levels. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content."}, "100": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "```json\n{'Image': 5, 'Rationale': 'Image 5 lists multiple languages which are used for some kind of experimentation in a table format.'}\n```\nThe answer is : Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam"}, "101": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "```json\n{'Image': 5, 'Rationale': 'Image 5 lists out the languages used for an experiment, including the training and testing hours for each one.'}\n```\nThe answer is : Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, and Malayalam. \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali,  English and Assamese (in table, missing in text)"}}
