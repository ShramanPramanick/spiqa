{"921": {"question": "What is the McGurk effect?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 is helpful as it gives a simple diagrammatic representation of what causes the McGurk effect.'}\nThe answer is : The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that demonstrates the interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The effect occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table5-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "8-Table7-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "a perceptual illusion, where listening to a speech sound while watching a mouth pronounce a different sound changes how the audio is heard"}, "922": {"question": "What is the McGurk effect?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 directly illustrates the McGurk effect with a simple visual of someone hearing one sound, seeing a speaker mouth a different sound, and perceiving a third, distinct sound.'}\nThe answer is : The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a person's perception of a spoken sound is influenced by the visual information they receive from the speaker's mouth movements. In other words, if you hear one sound (like \"ba\") but see a speaker's lips move as if they are saying a different sound (like \"ga\"), you may perceive a third sound (\"da\"). This effect highlights the interplay between our visual and auditory systems in processing speech. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "8-Table7-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "When the perception of what we hear is influenced by what we see."}}
