{"1043": {"question": "How do they match annotators to instances?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This table shows IE model performance for different annotator groups.'}\nThe answer is : The table shows the model performance when trained with annotations from different annotator groups (Difficult-Expert, Random-Expert, and Other).  This suggests they divide annotators based on their expertise and randomly assign instances within those groups. \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "8-Table6-1.png", "8-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table6-1.png"], "answer": "Annotations from experts are used if they have already been collected."}}
