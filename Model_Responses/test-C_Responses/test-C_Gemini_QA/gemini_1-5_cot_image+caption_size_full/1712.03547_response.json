{"920": {"question": "When they say \"comparable performance\", how much of a performance drop do these new embeddings result in?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 is a table of results comparing the baseline to the proposed method. This should contain quantitative information about performance drops.'}\nThe answer is : The provided text states that the proposed embeddings result in \"comparable performance\" on KG tasks.  While it does not specify the exact amount of performance drop, we can look at the table in Image 1 to see that the proposed method has slightly lower MRR and MR scores for Link Prediction and slightly higher AUC and Accuracy for Triple Classification. The differences range from roughly 1 to 2 percentage points.  Therefore, while there is a small performance drop in some metrics, the authors deem it to be small enough to be considered \"comparable.\" \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Performance was comparable, with the proposed method quite close and sometimes exceeding performance of baseline method."}}
