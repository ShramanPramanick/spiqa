The \"Background\" backoff strategy yields the lowest WER, followed by \"Neutral\" and then \"Pass-Through\". This suggests that the choice of backoff strategy can significantly impact the performance of a word recognition system. \n", "all_figures_names": ["1-Table1-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "In pass-through, the recognizer passes on the possibly misspelled word, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "748": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 mentions different backoff strategies like Pass-Through, Neutral, and Background with their corresponding Word Error Rates (WER).'}\nThe answer is : Although I can't see the images, based on the caption of Image 1, different backoff strategies likely refer to how a word recognition model handles out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. These strategies could involve using alternative models or techniques when the primary model encounters an unknown word, with the goal of minimizing the Word Error Rate (WER). \n", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table5-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "Pass-through passes the possibly misspelled word as is, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "749": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 is a table outlining WER of various backoff strategies.'}\nThe answer is : Image 4 shows various backoff strategies in the context of word recognition using a ScRNN model. The strategies are \"Pass-Through,\" \"Neutral,\" and \"Background.\" Each strategy employs a different approach for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or recognition errors.
