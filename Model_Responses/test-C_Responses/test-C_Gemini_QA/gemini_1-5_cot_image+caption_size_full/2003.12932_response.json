{"1063": {"question": "What is the performance change of the textual semantic similarity task when no error and maximum errors (noise) are present?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "```json\n{\n 'Image': 2,\n 'Rationale': 'This image displays the correlation between increasing errors and the performance on the STS-B dataset, which is a measure of textual semantic similarity.'\n}\n```\nThe answer is : The Pearson-Spearman correlation for the textual semantic similarity task is 0.89 when no error is present. When the error is maximum (20%), the correlation drops to 0.35.  This indicates a significant performance decrease with the increase in noise. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure5-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure5-1.png"], "answer": "10 Epochs: pearson-Spearman correlation  drops  60 points when error increase by 20%\n50 Epochs: pearson-Spearman correlation  drops  55 points when error increase by 20%"}, "1064": {"question": "Which sentiment analysis data set has a larger performance drop when a 10% error is introduced?", "referred_figures_indices": [3, 5], "response": "```json\n{\n 'Image': 5,\n 'Rationale': 'Image 5  shows the performance drop of SST-2 data when a 10% error is introduced.'\n}\n```\nThe answer is : The SST-2 dataset has a larger performance drop when a 10% error is introduced.
