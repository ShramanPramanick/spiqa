From the image we can see what visual tags such as disneyland, Metallica, stage, DJ are associated with the word Metallica.

The darker areas in the visualization represent stronger attention weights, indicating that the model focuses on relevant modalities (words, characters, or visual features) for entity recognition. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
