{"1009": {"question": "How do they correlate NED with emotional bond levels?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 is a table that shows the correlation between emotional bond and NED.'}\nThe answer is :  The Pearson's correlation between emotional bond and NED-TP is -0.1317 (p=0.3999), and between emotional bond and NED-PT is -0.4479 (p=0.0095). This shows that there is a statistically significant negative correlation between emotional bond and NED-PT, meaning that as emotional bond increases, NED-PT decreases. However, there is no statistically significant correlation between emotional bond and NED-TP. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "They compute Pearson\u2019s correlation between NED measure for patient-to-therapist and patient-perceived emotional bond rating and NED measure for therapist-to-patient and patient-perceived emotional bond rating"}}
