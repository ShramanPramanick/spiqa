{"1522": {"question": "What is the network architecture?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'This is the only image that depicts the architecture of a network.'}\nThe answer is : The network architecture consists of several layers, including a shared layer, POS layer, Chunk layer, and Language Modeling layer. Each layer receives input from the layer below it, with the exception of the shared layer, which receives Senna Word Embeddings. The POS and Chunk layers produce low dimension POS embeddings.
