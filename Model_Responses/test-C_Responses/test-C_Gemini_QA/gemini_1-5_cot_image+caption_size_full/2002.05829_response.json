{"1123": {"question": "How much does it minimally cost to fine-tune some model according to benchmarking framework?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 contains fine-tuning costs for several models.'}\nThe answer is : The minimal cost of fine-tuning, in terms of time, varies greatly depending on the specific model and benchmark being used. For example, fine-tuning ALBERT_LARGE for MNLI on a single GTX 2080 Ti GPU took 844.85 seconds, while fine-tuning BERT_LARGE for the same task took 9,106.72 seconds. The cost in dollars is not provided. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "5-Table4-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "$1,728"}, "1124": {"question": "What models are included in baseline benchmarking results?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 lists various baseline models like BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and ALBERT and their performance metrics.'}\nThe answer is : The baseline benchmarking results include models such as BERTBASE, BERTLARGE, XLNetBASE, XLNetLARGE, RoBERTaBASE, RoBERTaLARGE, ALBERTBASE, and ALBERTLarge. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "5-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "BERT, XLNET RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT"}}
