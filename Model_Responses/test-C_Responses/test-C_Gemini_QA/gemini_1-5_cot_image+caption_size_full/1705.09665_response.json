{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Image 2 gives multiple community examples along with their level of Distinctiveness and Dynamicity and visualizes how these attributes manifest.'}\nThe answer is : Distinctive communities like the Seahawks subreddit are defined by highly specific language reflecting their unique interests, while dynamic communities like Seahawks exhibit rapid changes in language use as discussions evolve. In contrast, consistent communities like Cooking maintain stable language over time, reflecting enduring themes.  Dynamic communities, regardless of distinctiveness, tend to retain users better due to constantly evolving content. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
