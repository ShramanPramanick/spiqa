{"534": {"question": "What different correlations result when using different variants of ROUGE scores?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "```json\n{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Image 3 directly shows different correlations that result from using different variants of ROUGE scores, while providing details on what each variant means.'}\n```\nThe answer is : Different variants of ROUGE scores such as using F-score, recall, or precision, as well as techniques like discounting, keyword query reformulation, and noun phrase query reformulation all affect correlation with human evaluation metrics like Pyramid scores. For example, ROUGE-SU-F shows a higher correlation with Pyramid scores compared to ROUGE-1-F.  Furthermore, using noun phrases for query reformulation in SERA shows a higher correlation with Pyramid scores than using keywords or no query reformulation. \n", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
