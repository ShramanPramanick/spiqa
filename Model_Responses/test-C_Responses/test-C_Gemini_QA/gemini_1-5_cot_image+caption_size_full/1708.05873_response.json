Image 2, which visualizes word probabilities for two topics, could hint at language differences, but it's not conclusive.  We need more context or information about the dataset's source and composition to determine if it's multilingual. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure10-1.png", "5-Figure7-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure6-1.png", "6-Figure11-1.png", "5-Figure9-1.png", "5-Figure8-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}, "71": {"question": "How are the main international development topics that states raise identified?", "referred_figures_indices": [2, 7], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Image 2 lists the highest probability words for each of the 16 identified topics related to international development. This is useful as it provides insight into the themes that emerge when states discuss development.'} \nThe answer is : While not explicitly stated, Image 2 suggests that international development topics are identified through analysis of frequently used words and phrases in relevant discussions and documents.  Each topic is characterized by a set of high-probability words, implying that topic modeling or similar text analysis techniques are used to reveal these themes. \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure8-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "6-Figure10-1.png", "5-Figure7-1.png", "6-Figure11-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": " They focus on exclusivity and semantic coherence measures: Highly frequent words in a given topic that do not appear very often in other topics are viewed as making that topic exclusive.
