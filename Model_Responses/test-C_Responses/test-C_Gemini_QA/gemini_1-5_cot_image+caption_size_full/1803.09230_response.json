However, it indicates that the Hybrid model, which potentially incorporates elements of the proposed method, achieves an F1 score of 70.95% and an EM score of 60.54%. \n", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "In terms of F1 score, the Hybrid approach improved by 23.47% and 1.39% on BiDAF and DCN respectively.
