MSD prediction focuses on assigning the correct morphological tag to a word based on its context, as seen in Image 3, where the model aims to predict \"V;PST;V.PTCP;PASS\" for the word \"make\". \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "The task of predicting MSD tags: V, PST, V.PCTP, PASS."}}
