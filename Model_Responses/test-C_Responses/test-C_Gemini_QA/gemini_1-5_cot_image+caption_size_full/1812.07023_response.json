However, it highlights the use of FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) as a technique for conditioning feature extraction, which proves beneficial in multi-modal tasks. \n", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table4-1.png"], "answer": "Answer with content missing: (list missing) \nScheduled sampling: In our experiments, we found that models trained with scheduled sampling performed better (about 0.004 BLEU-4 on validation set) than the ones trained using teacher-forcing for the AVSD dataset.
