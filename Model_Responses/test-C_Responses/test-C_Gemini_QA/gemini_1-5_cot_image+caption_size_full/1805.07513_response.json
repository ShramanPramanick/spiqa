{"1323": {"question": "Do they compare with the MAML algorithm?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 5, 'Rationale': 'Image 5 compares the accuracy of different few-shot learning models, including Matching Network and Prototypical Network, directly in the caption.'}\nThe answer is : While the provided context mentions Matching Network and Prototypical Network, it does not directly compare them to the MAML algorithm. Therefore, I cannot answer your question. \n", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "16-Table4-1.png", "16-Table3-1.png", "8-Table1-1.png", "9-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
