{"795": {"question": "Are some models evaluated using this metric, what are the findings?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 shows the performance of the model on relation classification'}\nThe answer is : Table 5 shows the performance of the model on relation classification.  The model achieves an overall accuracy of 44.37%. The model achieves high accuracy on some relations, such as JOINT, SEQUENCE, and SOLUTIONHOOD, but low accuracy on other relations, such as ANTITHESIS, BACKGROUND, and CAUSE.", "all_figures_names": ["18-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png", "13-Figure4-1.png", "14-Table5-1.png", "19-Figure6-1.png", "25-Figure7-1.png", "22-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["13-Figure4-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
