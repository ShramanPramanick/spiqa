In Table 4, we can see that the accuracy of the model decreases after applying the adversarial attack. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, this adversarial approach is not used to directly improve model accuracy, but rather to test its robustness.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "12-Table7-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Table7-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
