{"921": {"question": "What is the McGurk effect?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 best shows the McGurk effect because it is an illustration of the concept.'}\nThe answer is : The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. In this effect, a person's perception of a spoken sound can be altered by the visual information they see at the same time. For instance, if someone sees a person's lips making the movement for the sound \"ga\" while hearing the sound \"ba,\" they may perceive the sound as \"da.\" This occurs because the visual and auditory information is integrated by the brain, leading to a perception that is different from either sensory input alone.", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table7-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table5-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "a perceptual illusion, where listening to a speech sound while watching a mouth pronounce a different sound changes how the audio is heard"}, "922": {"question": "What is the McGurk effect?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 illustrates the effect of the McGurk effect. It shows a person hearing a different sound than what their eyes see, which is a clear example of this phenomenon.'}\nThe answer is : The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that demonstrates how visual information can influence auditory perception. When the visual information that a person sees does not match the auditory information they hear, they will perceive a different sound than what they are actually hearing. For example, if someone sees the mouth movements for the sound \"ga\" but hears the sound \"ba,\" they will likely perceive the sound \"da.\" This is because the brain integrates visual and auditory information to create a single perception, and if the two inputs conflict, the brain will tend to favor the visual information. The McGurk effect is a powerful demonstration of how our brains can be tricked by our senses.", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table7-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "6-Table5-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "When the perception of what we hear is influenced by what we see."}}
