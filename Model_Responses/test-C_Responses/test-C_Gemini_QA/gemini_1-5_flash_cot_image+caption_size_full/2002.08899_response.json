'}\nThe answer is : The paper does not explicitly perform a quantitative analysis on knowledge distortion. However, it does compare the performance of its model on different tasks with the performance of other models, allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effects of knowledge distortion.  The paper doesn't explicitly focus on this specific distortion.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "875": {"question": "How do they damage different neural modules?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Image 3 shows the results of damaging different modules, and provides precision scores for different inputs, demonstrating the impact of damage.'}\nThe answer is : By randomly initializing the weights of different modules, the model can be made to simulate Wernicke's and Broca's aphasia. This causes the model to lose all learned information and makes it perform poorly on certain tasks. Table 2 shows the precision scores for different inputs when the LSTM modules or the lexicon unit are damaged. This demonstrates how the model's performance changes depending on the damaged module, providing insight into how they affect the model's ability to process language.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Damage to neural modules is done by randomly initializing their weights, causing the loss of all learned information."}}
