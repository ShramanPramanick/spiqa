{"87": {"question": "How better is accuracy of new model compared to previously reported models?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Table shows accuracy comparison of different models'}\nThe answer is : The accuracy of PRN model (56.31) on Cloze Coherence task is better than previous models like Hasty Student (27.35), Impatient Reader (27.36) and BiDAF (53.95). However, the accuracy of PRN (46.45) on Cloze Coherence task is less than BiDAF w/ static memory (47.81) model.  The average accuracy of PRN (57.57) is higher than all previous models.", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Average accuracy of proposed model vs best prevous result:\nSingle-task Training: 57.57 vs 55.06\nMulti-task Training: 50.17 vs 50.59"}}
