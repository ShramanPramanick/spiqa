However, it does present results comparing various models, including \"Matching Network\" (Vinyals et al., 2016), which is a known meta-learning approach related to MAML.  The paper's \"ROBUSTTC-FSL\" method outperforms the \"Matching Network\" on both sentiment and intent classification tasks, indicating its potential competitiveness in few-shot learning compared to other meta-learning methods.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "16-Table3-1.png", "16-Table4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Figure3-1.png", "8-Table1-1.png", "9-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
