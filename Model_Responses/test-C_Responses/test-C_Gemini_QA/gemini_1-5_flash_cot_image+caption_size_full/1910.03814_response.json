{"214": {"question": "What is the results of multimodal compared to unimodal models?", "referred_figures_indices": [2, 6], "response": "{'Image': 6, 'Rationale': 'This table shows the performance of various models with different inputs.'}\nThe answer is : Multimodal models achieve higher performance than unimodal models by utilizing both image and text information. This leads to more accurate results, especially in tasks like hate speech detection where the combination of visual and textual context is crucial.
