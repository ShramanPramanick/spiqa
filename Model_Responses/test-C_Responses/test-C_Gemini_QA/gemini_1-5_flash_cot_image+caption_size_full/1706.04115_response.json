{"1436": {"question": "How is the input triple translated to a slot-filling task?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 6, 'Rationale': 'It shows the translation of the input triple to natural language question templates'}\nThe answer is : The input triple is translated to a slot-filling task by using natural language question templates that map to the knowledge-base relations. For example, the relation 'educated_at(x, y)' is mapped to the question templates 'Where did x graduate from?', 'In which university did x study?', and 'What is x's alma mater?'.", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table5-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["1-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "The relation R(x,y) is mapped onto a question q whose answer is y"}}
