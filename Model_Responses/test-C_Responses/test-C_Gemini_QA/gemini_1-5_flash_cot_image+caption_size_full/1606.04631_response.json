The methods are compared based on their METEOR score, with higher scores indicating better performance.  The Joint-BiLSTM reinforced model achieves the highest METEOR score of 30.3.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "S2VT, RGB (VGG), RGB (VGG)+Flow (AlexNet), LSTM-E (VGG), LSTM-E (C3D) and Yao et al."}}
