{"309": {"question": "What was the performance of their model?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 provides a table with performance of different models on the test datasets.'}\nThe answer is : The performance of different models on the test datasets is shown in the table. The models are: Baseline, Ablation, Ablation with Mask, Ours without Mask, Ours with Mask, Ours without Mask and with Ordered Triplets, and Ours with Mask and Ordered Triplets. The table shows the performance of each model on two test datasets: Test-Repeated and Test-New. The performance is measured by EM (Exact Match), F1, ED (Edit Distance), and GM (Geometric Mean). The symbol \u2191 indicates that higher results are better in the corresponding column; \u2193 indicates that lower is better. The best performing model is Ours with Mask and Ordered Triplets, which achieved a GM of 61.36 on the Test-Repeated dataset and 41.81 on the Test-New dataset.", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure3-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "9-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "For test-repeated set, EM score of 61.17, F1 of 93.54, ED of 0.75 and GM of 61.36.
