This approach has been shown to be effective for zero-shot translation, where the model is able to translate between language pairs it has not been explicitly trained on. For example, a model trained on English, Spanish, and French can be used to translate between Portuguese and Swedish, even though it has never seen these languages before. This is because the model has learned a general representation of language that can be applied to new languages. The model is able to learn about the relationship between languages and transfer that knowledge to new tasks.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
