{"534": {"question": "What different correlations result when using different variants of ROUGE scores?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Provides correlations with different variants of ROUGE'}\nThe answer is :  The answer to the question lies in the correlations of different variants of ROUGE. The table reveals, for instance, that discounted variants of SERA, which adjust for summary length, have high correlations with ROUGE-W variants, which emphasize recall of words. This finding suggests that both metrics emphasize content coverage in a similar manner. Similarly, the use of keywords (KW) in query reformulation for SERA leads to a greater correlation with ROUGE variants that prioritize phrase-level recall (ROUGE-L). This suggests that both metrics are sensitive to the presence of key phrases in the summary. Overall, the table highlights the relationships between ROUGE variants and the different variants of SERA, providing insights into the specific aspects of summary quality that each metric prioritizes.", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
