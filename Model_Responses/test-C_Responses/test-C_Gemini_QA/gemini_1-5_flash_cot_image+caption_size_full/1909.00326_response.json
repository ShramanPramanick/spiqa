{"662": {"question": "How do they measure which words are under-translated by NMT models?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This table shows the accuracy of different methods in detecting under-translation errors'}\nThe answer is :  The paper used F1 scores to measure the accuracy of different methods in detecting under-translation errors.  The methods included Attention, Erasure, and Attribution.  The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which means that it considers both the number of correctly identified under-translation errors and the number of errors that were missed. The method with the highest F1 score (0.342) is the Attribution method.", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "11-Table5-1.png", "11-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
