Functional dissimilarity scores are a measure of the quality of learned embeddings, with lower scores indicating better performance. Therefore, they do conduct quantitative quality analysis of learned embeddings. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "6-Table5-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "1134": {"question": "Do they evaluate on downstream tasks?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'The table lists downstream performance in terms of accuracy'}\nThe answer is : Yes, they evaluate on downstream tasks like syntactic nearest neighbour.", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table5-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table6-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
