{"543": {"question": "how is mitigation of gender bias evaluated?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 shows various evaluation metrics and how they change depending on the chosen mitigation method'}\nThe answer is : The evaluation of gender bias mitigation methods is often done by applying metrics like bias detection and comparing the results of different models. For example, in the table shown, the values for CB (conditional bias) decrease when certain mitigation methods like \"lambda 1\" are used, suggesting a reduction in gender bias.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1"}}
