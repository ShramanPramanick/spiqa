{"802": {"question": "How strong is the correlation between the prevalence of the #MeToo movement and official reports [of sexual harassment]?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 contains a table with linear regression results, which directly relates to the correlation between features, including \"Normalized cases count\" and the \"Me Too\" movement prevalence.'}\nThe answer is :  Image 0 provides the results of a linear regression analysis. Based on this analysis, the strength of the correlation between the prevalence of the #MeToo movement and official reports of sexual harassment can be assessed by looking at the coefficient and p-value associated with the \"Normalized cases count\" variable. The coefficient suggests the direction and magnitude of the relationship, while the p-value indicates the statistical significance of the correlation.  To provide a more precise answer, we would need access to the data and the specific definitions of \"Normalized cases count\" and \"Me Too\" prevalence used in this analysis. \n", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "0.9098 correlation"}, "805": {"question": "Which geographical regions correlate to the trend?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Table 2 shows the linear regression results for the features of the regions, which can be helpful for identifying geographical correlation.'}\nThe answer is : The geographical regions that correlate with the trend are Northeast, West and South based on the statistically significant p-values of 0.0370, 0.0283, and 0.0468 respectively.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Northeast U.S., West U.S. and South U.S."}}
