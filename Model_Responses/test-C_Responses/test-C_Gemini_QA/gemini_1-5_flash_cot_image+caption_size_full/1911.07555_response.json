{"621": {"question": "Does the paper report the performance of a baseline model on South African languages LID?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'It shows different LID models and their performance.'}\nThe answer is : The paper doesn't report a baseline model performance.

It only mentions that the models run by the authors are marked with an asterisk (*). Additionally, the table lists the performance of the models on several different datasets, including DSL15, but not South African languages.  Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the paper reports the performance of a baseline model on South African languages LID from this table. \n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "624": {"question": "Does the algorithm improve on the state-of-the-art methods?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Image 2 shows the performance of the proposed model and several other existing models.'}\nThe answer is : The algorithm improves on the state-of-the-art methods as it achieves a better accuracy score than all other models on the NCHLT dataset.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "625": {"question": "Does the algorithm improve on the state-of-the-art methods?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'This table shows the accuracy of various models for language identification.
