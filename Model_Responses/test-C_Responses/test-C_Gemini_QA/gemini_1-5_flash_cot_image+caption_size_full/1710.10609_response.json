{"701": {"question": "Do they study frequent user responses to help automate modelling of those?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'It shows examples of customer and agent conversations with their responses being clustered'}\nThe answer is :  While not explicitly stated, this image suggests that they may study frequent user responses to help automate modelling of those. This is indicated by the clustering of conversations, suggesting that certain responses are grouped together based on their frequency and content. This implies that the model could potentially be trained on these clusters to anticipate and automate responses.", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure5-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "703": {"question": "Do they use the same distance metric for both the SimCluster and K-means algorithm?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'This table shows the performance of K-means and SimCluster, which gives information on their performance'}\nThe answer is : The document does not mention what distance metric is used in SimCluster or K-means.
