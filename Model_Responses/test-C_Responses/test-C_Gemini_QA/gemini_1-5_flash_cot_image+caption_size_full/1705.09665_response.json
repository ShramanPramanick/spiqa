{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Image 3 provides examples of communities like Seahawks and Cooking, which exhibit different levels of distinctiveness and dynamicity, helping understand how these social phenomena manifest in various communities.'}\nThe answer is :  The social phenomena of distinctiveness and dynamicity, as defined by the study, manifest differently in various communities. Communities like Seahawks (a football team) are more distinctive, using specific language and experiencing higher dynamism, with discussions changing throughout the football season. In contrast, communities like Cooking have a more stable and consistent content, exhibiting lower dynamicity. These differences contribute to varying user retention rates, highlighting the impact of these social phenomena on community dynamics.", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
