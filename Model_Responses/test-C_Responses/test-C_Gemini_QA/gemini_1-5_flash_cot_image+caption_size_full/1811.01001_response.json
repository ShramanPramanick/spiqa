{"947": {"question": "Are the unobserved samples from the same distribution as the training data?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'This image shows the performance of LSTM models trained on different distributions.'}\nThe answer is :  The unobserved samples may or may not come from the same distribution as the training data. This is because the graphs in the image shows the performance of LSTMs trained under different probability distribution regimes, and the performance is not consistent across the different regimes. This suggests that the unobserved samples may be from a different distribution than the training data, and the performance of the LSTM will be affected.", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure4-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png", "9-Figure5-1.png", "10-Figure7-1.png", "10-Figure6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
