{"951": {"question": "What are the qualitative experiments performed on benchmark datasets?", "referred_figures_indices": [3, 0], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 shows qualitative results of GM KL'}\nThe answer is :  The qualitative experiments performed on benchmark datasets can be seen in the table, which shows nearest neighbours of words based on context.  The table shows that the model is able to correctly identify the nearest neighbours of words based on context, and thus demonstrates its ability to generalize to new words and contexts.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table4-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table3-1.png", "5-Table4-1.png"], "answer": "Spearman correlation values of GM_KL model evaluated on the benchmark word similarity datasets.\nEvaluation results of GM_KL model on the entailment datasets such as entailment pairs dataset created from WordNet, crowdsourced dataset of 79 semantic relations labelled as entailed or not and annotated distributionally similar nouns dataset."}}
