For example, if images of Asian people are more likely to be captioned with terms like \"Asian baby\" or \"Asian child\" compared to images of White people, this might indicate a bias towards viewing Asian people as less mature or developed. Another method is to examine the language used to describe different groups of people. For example, if images of Black people are more likely to be captioned with terms that emphasize their race or ethnicity, such as \"African-American\" or \"Black baby,\" compared to images of White people, this might indicate a bias towards viewing Black people as more racialized or stereotyped.", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Looking for adjectives marking the noun \"baby\" and also looking for most-common adjectives related to certain nouns using POS-tagging"}, "62": {"question": "What biases are found in the dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 provides a table detailing the number of times ethnicity is mentioned'}\nThe answer is : The dataset shows bias toward Asian people with 60% of the descriptions mentioning their ethnicity/race.
