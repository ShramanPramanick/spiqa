It has a higher mean rank than other models except for the Uniform model, which is a bit higher, and the bi-ranker model, which is much higher. Despite having lower MRR, the model still outperforms others in most of the metrics.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure5-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure6-1.png", "3-Figure4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Metric difference between Aloha and best baseline score:\nHits@1/20: +0.061 (0.3642 vs 0.3032)\nMRR: +0.0572(0.5114 vs 0.4542)\nF1: -0.0484 (0.3901 vs 0.4385)\nBLEU: +0.0474 (0.2867 vs 0.2393)"}}
