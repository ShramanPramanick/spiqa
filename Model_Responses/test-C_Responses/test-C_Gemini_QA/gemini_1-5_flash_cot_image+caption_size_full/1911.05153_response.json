The performance improvement ranges from 0.1% to 12.1% in various categories like \"Adv cs\" and \"Adv seq2seq\".", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Data augmentation (es)  improved Adv es by 20% comparing to baseline \nData augmentation (cs) improved Adv cs by 16.5% comparing to baseline\nData augmentation (cs+es) improved both Adv cs and Adv es by at least 10% comparing to baseline \nAll models show improvements over adversarial sets  \n"}}
