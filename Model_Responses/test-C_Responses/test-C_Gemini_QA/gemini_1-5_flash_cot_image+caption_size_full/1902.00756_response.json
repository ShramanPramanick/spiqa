{"1470": {"question": "So this paper turns unstructured text inputs to parameters that GNNs can read?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 illustrates the entire architecture and how the unstructured input is transformed into parameters for GNN'}\nThe answer is : Yes, this paper describes a method for transforming unstructured text inputs into parameters that can be read by a Graph Neural Network (GNN).  The paper describes a method that utilizes an encoding module to transform unstructured text inputs into a transition matrix, which is then used by the propagation module to create parameters that can be read by a GNN.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
