{"558": {"question": "What are their results on both datasets?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Table contains results for various datasets and approaches'}\nThe answer is : The results show that the model has different performance depending on the dataset and method used.  For example, on the FCE dataset, the model has the highest F0.5 score of 62.47 when using the Ann-PAT method.  However, on the CoNLL-14 TEST1 dataset, the model has the highest F0.5 score of 23.28 when using the Ann-PAT+MT method.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Combining  pattern based and Machine translation approaches gave the best overall F0.5 scores. It was 49.11 for FCE dataset  , 21.87 for the first annotation of  CoNLL-14, and 30.13 for the second annotation of CoNLL-14. "}}
