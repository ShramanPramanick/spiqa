It mentions \"various measures\" and highlights the \"strong\" correlation with \"\u2217p < 0.05\". Therefore, it likely implies that NED is one of those measures that correlate with emotional bond levels.'}\n```", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "They compute Pearson\u2019s correlation between NED measure for patient-to-therapist and patient-perceived emotional bond rating and NED measure for therapist-to-patient and patient-perceived emotional bond rating"}}
