These embeddings are created from external word or sentence embeddings, and they are integrated into the decoder network through a contextual gating mechanism (Figure 3). This mechanism allows the system to consider the conversational context, previous word, and current speech when making recognition decisions.'}\n```", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer."}}
