{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "```json\n{'Answer': 'The provided captions focus on how community characteristics like language distinctiveness and dynamicity influence user retention and acculturation gaps.  While they don\u2019t directly examine the manifestation of social phenomena across different types of communities, they suggest that communities with unique language and rapid change in topics tend to have higher user retention. This implies that such communities might foster stronger social bonds and engagement, attracting users who are drawn to the dynamic nature of the conversation. The acculturation gap, which measures linguistic differences between established members and outsiders, is larger in communities with unique and stable language, suggesting that these communities may be more exclusive or resistant to external influences. However, the captions lack specific examples of different types of communities to illustrate these phenomena, making it difficult to provide a comprehensive answer to the question.'}\n```", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
