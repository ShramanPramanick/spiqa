{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Answer': 'A confusion network, also known as a lattice, is a graph structure that represents multiple alternative transcriptions or interpretations of a given input, such as speech or handwriting. It encodes the probabilities of different word sequences or hypotheses. Unlike a simple sequence, a confusion network allows for branching and merging paths, reflecting the ambiguity inherent in the recognition process. Each node in the network typically corresponds to a word or sub-word unit, while edges represent transitions between them with associated probabilities. The \"confusion\" aspect arises from the fact that the network captures the uncertainty or confusion of the recognizer about the true output.'}\n", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
