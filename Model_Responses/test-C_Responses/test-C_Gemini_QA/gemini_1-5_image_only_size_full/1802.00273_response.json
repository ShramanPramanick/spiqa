{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Neural machine translation models can leverage transfer learning by training on a large corpus of parallel text in multiple languages, such as Bible translations. This allows the model to learn a shared vector space representation of languages, which can then be used to translate between language pairs that were not explicitly included in the training data (zero-shot translation). This transfer learning approach enables the model to generalize to new languages and improve translation quality even for low-resource language pairs.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
