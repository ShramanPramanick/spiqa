The provided images illustrate different backoff techniques, including:\\n\\n1. **Pass-through:**  This strategy simply passes the unknown word through to the next processing step without any modification. It assumes that subsequent layers or modules might be able to handle it.  This is evident in Image 1 and Image 5, where \"Pass-Through\" is listed as a backoff variant.\\n\\n2. **Neutral:** This approach replaces the unknown word with a neutral token, often representing an average or generic embedding. This helps to mitigate the impact of unknown words on the model's predictions. Image 1, Image 2, Image 3, and Image 5 all feature \"Neutral\" as a backoff option.\\n\\n3. **Background:** In this strategy, a separate background model, potentially trained on a larger or more diverse dataset, is used to generate a representation for the unknown word. This representation is then incorporated into the primary model's processing. Image 1, Image 2, Image 4, and Image 5 demonstrate the use of a \"Background\" model for backoff.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of each backoff strategy depends on various factors, including the specific task, the nature of the unknown words, and the capabilities of the models involved.
