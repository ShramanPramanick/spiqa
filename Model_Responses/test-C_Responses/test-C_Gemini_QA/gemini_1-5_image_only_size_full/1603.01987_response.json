Wikipedia aims to provide information that is accessible to a wide audience, and using overly technical language goes against that goal. A good medical Wikipedia article would explain complex medical terms in simpler language or provide links to pages with definitions.'}", "all_figures_names": ["10-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "12-Table4-1.png", "11-Figure4-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "13-Table5-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
