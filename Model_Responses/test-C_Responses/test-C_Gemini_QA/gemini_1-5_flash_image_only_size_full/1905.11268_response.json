The backoff strategies are used to handle unknown words or characters during the processing. These strategies work by using different models to predict the unknown words or characters. For example, a \"pass-through\" strategy uses a model that simply passes the unknown word or character through the system. A \"background\" strategy uses a model that is trained on a large corpus of text to predict the unknown word or character. A \"neutral\" strategy uses a model that is trained on a smaller corpus of text to predict the unknown word or character.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "In pass-through, the recognizer passes on the possibly misspelled word, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "748": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Backoff strategies are methods that allow the model to recover from adversarial attacks by using a different model if the current model fails.
