It allows for the representation of multiple potential words at a time, which is useful for dealing with the ambiguity of speech recognition. A lattice is a similar structure to a confusion network, but it may also contain cycles. Confusion networks and lattices are used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) to represent the possible word sequences and to calculate the probability of each sequence.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
