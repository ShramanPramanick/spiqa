This can be seen by the fact that the generalization error for the unobserved samples is significantly higher than the generalization error for the training data. This suggests that the model is overfitting to the training data and is not able to generalize well to new data.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure3-1.png", "9-Figure5-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png", "10-Figure7-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "8-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure1-1.png", "10-Figure6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
