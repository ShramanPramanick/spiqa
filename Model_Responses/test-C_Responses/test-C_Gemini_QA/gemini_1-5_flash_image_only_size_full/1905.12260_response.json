The table in image 1 shows that MUSE 300-Dim model achieved the best results, which is significantly better than other models. The MUSE model leverages the visual information from images to generate more meaningful multilingual representations, which leads to better performance in cross-lingual image retrieval tasks. Therefore, the visual grounding plays a crucial role in improving the performance of multilingual representations.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "performance is significantly degraded without pixel data"}}
