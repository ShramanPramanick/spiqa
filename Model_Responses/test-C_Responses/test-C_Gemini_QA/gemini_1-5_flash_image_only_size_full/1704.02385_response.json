{"1304": {"question": "how was annotation done?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "```json\n{'Answer': 'The paper utilizes a hierarchical multi-label classification model, each node represents a class. The annotation is done by manually classifying each post into the corresponding class, and the class is labeled with the corresponding node. For example, the \"intention\" node has children nodes \"no trolling\", \"trolling/mock trolling\", \"trolling\". If a post is classified as \"trolling\", it will be labeled with the \"trolling\" node. The same applies to other nodes. The classification is done in a hierarchical manner, if a post is classified as \"trolling\", it can also be classified as \"trolling/mock trolling\" or \"trolling\" based on the specific content of the post.'}\n```", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Annotation was done with the help of annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk on snippets of conversations"}}
