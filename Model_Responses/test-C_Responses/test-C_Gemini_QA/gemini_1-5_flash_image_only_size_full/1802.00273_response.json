{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Answer': 'Neural machine translation (NMT) models can learn to translate new language pairs without explicit training data, as shown in Image 1. This concept is known as \"zero-shot MT\". The models can leverage existing knowledge of related languages or even the structure of languages, as illustrated in Image 2. The ability of NMT models to transfer knowledge across languages relies on the shared underlying semantic representation of meaning. Images 2 and 3 showcase the representation of meaning in NMT models, where diverse languages are mapped to a common semantic space. This transfer learning capability allows NMT models to effectively adapt to new languages by leveraging existing knowledge and understanding.
