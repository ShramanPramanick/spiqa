This indicates that NED has a negative correlation with emotional bond levels, meaning that as NED increases, emotional bond levels decrease.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "They compute Pearson\u2019s correlation between NED measure for patient-to-therapist and patient-perceived emotional bond rating and NED measure for therapist-to-patient and patient-perceived emotional bond rating"}}
