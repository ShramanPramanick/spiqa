The proposed method can be applied to any language pair and any technical domain. The key is to identify and extract technical terms from the input text, and then translate them using a suitable SMT model. The translated technical terms can then be used to train an NMT model, which can be used to translate the entire text.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure4-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "9-Figure6-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png"], "answer": "There is no reason to think that this approach wouldn't also be successful for other technical domains. Technical terms are replaced with tokens, therefore so as long as there is a corresponding process for identifying and replacing technical terms in the new domain this approach could be viable."}}
