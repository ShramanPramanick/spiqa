{"543": {"question": "how is mitigation of gender bias evaluated?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "```json\n{'Answer': 'The mitigation of gender bias is evaluated by comparing the performance of different bias mitigation techniques. This can be done by comparing the values of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For example, in the given table, we can see that the performance of the model on the CB_o metric, which measures the bias towards specific occupations, decreases significantly after applying different bias mitigation techniques. This suggests that the mitigation techniques are effective in reducing the bias towards specific occupations. In addition, the table also shows the performance of different techniques on other metrics like B^N, B^N_C, GR, Ppl., CB_g, and EB_d. These metrics capture different aspects of the model\u2019s performance and help evaluate the overall effectiveness of the bias mitigation techniques.'}\n```", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1"}}
