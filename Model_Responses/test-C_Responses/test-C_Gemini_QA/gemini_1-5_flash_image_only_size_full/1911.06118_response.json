This is because the method is able to capture the semantic relationships between words better than other methods.\\n\\n* **Sentence Similarity:** The results show that the proposed method is able to achieve competitive performance on the sentence similarity datasets (SL, MEN, MC). This is because the method is able to capture the semantic relationships between sentences better than other methods.\\n\\n* **MT-287 and MT-771:** The results show that the proposed method is able to achieve comparable performance on the MT-287 and MT-771 datasets. This suggests that the method is also able to capture the semantic relationships between words in different languages.\\n\\n* **(Turney and Pantel 2015):** The results show that the proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the dataset used in the study by Turney and Pantel (2015).\\n\\n* **(Baroni et al. 2012):** The results show that the proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the dataset used in the study by Baroni et al.
