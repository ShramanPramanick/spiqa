{"1273": {"question": "Do they visualize the difference between AM-Softmax and regular softmax?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': 'Image 1 shows a visual representation of the difference between the two. Regular softmax uses a linear decision boundary to separate the classes, while AM-Softmax pushes the decision boundary further away from the data points, creating a larger margin.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-TableI-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
