The difference between the two can be used to estimate how much a word contributed to the translation. The bigger the difference, the more important the word, and the more under-translated the word is by the NMT model.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "11-Table6-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
