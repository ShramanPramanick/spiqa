{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'The provided images explore how social phenomena like community dynamics and user retention manifest in different types of online communities. Image 2 shows the classification of communities based on their \"dynamic\" and \"consistent\" nature and \"generic\" and \"distinctive\" content. The images suggest that communities with more dynamic and distinctive content tend to have higher user retention (Image 1) and lower acculturation gap (Image 0). This indicates that dynamic and distinctive communities may attract users who are more engaged and actively participate, leading to greater retention and a lower acculturation gap. Image 3 shows the relationship between community-level measures like dynamism and distinctiveness and the rate of user retention. It highlights that communities with higher dynamism and distinctiveness tend to have higher user retention.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
