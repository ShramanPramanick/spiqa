This can be seen in the distribution of followers (Image 6), where fake news accounts generally have fewer followers than legitimate accounts. Fake news accounts also tend to have a smaller number of friends compared to their followers, as seen in the distribution of the ratio of friends to followers (Image 4 and Image 7), where fake news accounts have a lower ratio compared to legitimate accounts.
