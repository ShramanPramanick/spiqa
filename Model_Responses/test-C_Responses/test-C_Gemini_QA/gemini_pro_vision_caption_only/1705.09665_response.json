For example, communities like Seahawks (a football team) and Cooking use highly distinctive language and have higher user retention rates.\\n\\n- **Dynamicity**: Communities that use very dynamic language (i.e., the discussion continually shifts) are also more likely to retain users. For example, Seahawks uses very dynamic language, as the discussion continually shifts throughout the football season, and has a high user retention rate.\\n\\n- **Acculturation Gap**: The size of the acculturation gap varies systematically according to how dynamic and distinctive a community is. Distinctive communities exhibit larger gaps; as do relatively stable, and very dynamic communities.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
