First, it classifies the user's query into one of three intents: math, org, or text. \n2. If the intent is math, the system then extracts the relevant information from the query using a combination of information extraction and natural language processing techniques. \n3. The system then checks if the information extracted is correct and complete and asks the user for confirmation if necessary. \n4. Finally, the system responds to the user's query with the requested information or an appropriate action.", "all_figures_names": ["9-Table11-1.png", "12-Table18-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "10-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "12-Table17-1.png", "13-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "It defined a sequence labeling task to extract custom entities from user input and label the next action (out of 13  custom actions defined)."}}
