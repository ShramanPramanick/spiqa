The second image shows the attention weights of different models on a few examples. The third image shows the architecture of the neural module network. From the results, we can see that the model with adversarial training has the best performance. From the attention weights, we can see that the model with adversarial training pays more attention to the correct words. From the architecture, we can see that the neural module network consists of an encoder, a decoder, and an attention mechanism.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Damage to neural modules is done by randomly initializing their weights, causing the loss of all learned information."}}
