{"1522": {"question": "What is the network architecture?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": " The image shows a neural network architecture for  chunking. The architecture consists of a language model, a POS tagger, and a chunker. The language model is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is used to learn the probability of a word given the previous words in a sentence. The POS tagger is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to learn the part-of-speech tag of a word given its context. The chunker is a CRF that is used to learn the sequence of chunks in a sentence.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table6-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "The network architecture has a multi-task Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Network, with an unsupervised sequence labeling task and a low-dimensional embedding layer between tasks. There is a hidden layer after each successive task with skip connections to the senior supervised layers."}}
