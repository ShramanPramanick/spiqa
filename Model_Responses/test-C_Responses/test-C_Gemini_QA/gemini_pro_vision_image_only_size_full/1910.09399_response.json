{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": " {'Answer': 'The typical GAN architectures for each text-to-image synthesis group are:\\n\\n- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are a type of generative model that uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to generate new data. The generator network takes a random noise vector as input and produces an image, while the discriminator network takes an image as input and outputs a probability that the image is real or fake. The two networks are trained together in an adversarial process, where the generator network tries to fool the discriminator network and the discriminator network tries to correctly classify real and fake images.\\n\\n- Stacked GANs: Stacked GANs are a type of GAN that uses multiple generator and discriminator networks stacked on top of each other. The generator networks are trained to generate images at different levels of detail, while the discriminator networks are trained to classify images at different levels of detail. This allows Stacked GANs to generate images that are both high-quality and realistic.\\n\\n- Attention GANs: Attention GANs are a type of GAN that uses an attention mechanism to focus on specific parts of the image when generating or discriminating images. This allows Attention GANs to generate images that are more realistic and detailed.\\n\\n- Conditional GANs: Conditional GANs are a type of GAN that takes additional input, such as a text caption or a label, to generate images. This allows Conditional GANs to generate images that are more specific and relevant to the input.\\n\\n- Progressive GANs: Progressive GANs are a type of GAN that trains the generator and discriminator networks in stages. In the first stage, the generator network is trained to generate low-resolution images, and the discriminator network is trained to classify low-resolution images. In the next stage, the generator network is trained to generate higher-resolution images, and the discriminator network is trained to classify higher-resolution images. This process is repeated until the generator network is able to generate high-quality, realistic images.\\n\\n- StyleGANs: StyleGANs are a type of GAN that uses a style-based generator network to generate images. The style-based generator network takes a style vector as input and generates an image that is styled according to the style vector. This allows StyleGANs to generate images with a wide variety of styles.'}", "all_figures_names": ["21-Figure11-1.png", "18-Table1-1.png", "21-Figure10-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "22-Figure12-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "10-Figure8-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
