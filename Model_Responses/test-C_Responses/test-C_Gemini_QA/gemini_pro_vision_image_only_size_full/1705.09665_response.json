For example, in dynamic communities, social phenomena are more likely to be related to current events and trends, while in consistent communities, social phenomena are more likely to be related to long-standing traditions and values. Additionally, the rate of retention and average tenure of community members may be affected by the level of dynamism and distinctiveness within the community.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
