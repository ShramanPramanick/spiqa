In the first image, the blue line (AM-Softmax) has a lower error rate than the red line (Softmax) at 50 epochs. In the second image, the AM-Softmax has a lower error rate than the Softmax at 352 epochs. In the third image, the AM-Softmax has a larger margin than the Softmax, which should make it more robust to noise and other distortions.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png", "4-TableI-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
