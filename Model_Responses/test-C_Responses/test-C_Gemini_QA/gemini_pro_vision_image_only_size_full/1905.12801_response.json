PPL measures how well a language model can predict the next word in a sequence, and lower PPL indicates better performance. Mitigation of gender bias can also be done by using  log probability, as shown in Image 1.'}", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1"}}
