The embeddings are used to represent the meaning of the words in the sentence, and are incorporated into the speech recognition system by being used as input to the decoder. The decoder then uses these embeddings to generate the corresponding words in the sentence.'}", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer."}}
