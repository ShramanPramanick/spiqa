For example, in the case of hate speech detection, a multimodal model can use both the text and image content to make a more accurate prediction. This is because the image content can provide additional context that can help to disambiguate the meaning of the text. For example, an image of a person holding a gun can help to identify a threat, even if the text itself does not contain any explicit threats.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure6-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "7-Figure7-1.png", "6-Figure5-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure6-1.png"], "answer": "Unimodal LSTM vs Best Multimodal (FCM)\n- F score: 0.703 vs 0.704\n- AUC: 0.732 vs 0.734 \n- Mean Accuracy: 68.3 vs 68.4 "}}
