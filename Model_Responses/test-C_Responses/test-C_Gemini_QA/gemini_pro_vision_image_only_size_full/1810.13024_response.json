It is a directed acyclic graph in which the nodes represent the possible states of the speech recognizer, and the arcs represent the possible transitions between these states. The arcs are labeled with the acoustic features that are associated with each transition. The confusion network can be used to find the most likely sequence of words that was spoken, or to identify the words that were spoken with the highest confidence.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
