The baseline model consists of a document encoder, a sentence encoder, and a decoder. The document encoder encodes the entire document into a fixed-length vector. The sentence encoder encodes each sentence in the document into a fixed-length vector. The decoder then decodes the sequence of sentence vectors into a summary.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table2-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "There were hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines; BERT was one of those baselines"}}
