{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": " {'Answer': 'Neural machine translation (NMT) models can learn to translate between different languages without any parallel data. This is called zero-shot machine translation. In this setting, the model is trained on a large dataset of text in one language, and then it is fine-tuned on a small dataset of text in another language. The model learns to transfer its knowledge from the first language to the second language, and it can then be used to translate text from the second language to the first language.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
