{"99": {"question": "What is the GhostVLAD approach?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": " {'Answer': 'GhostVLAD is a method that uses a two-branch neural network to extract features from audio data. The first branch of the network extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each frame of audio data. The second branch of the network extracts a variable-length feature vector from each frame of audio data. The two feature vectors are then concatenated and used to classify the audio data.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content."}, "100": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": " {'Answer': 'The 7 Indian languages experimented with are Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam"}, "101": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": " {'Answer': 'The 7 Indian languages experimented with are Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali,  English and Assamese (in table, missing in text)"}}
