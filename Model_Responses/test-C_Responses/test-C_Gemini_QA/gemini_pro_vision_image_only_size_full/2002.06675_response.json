We can see that the word error rate (WER) is 21.7% and the phone error rate (PER) is 6.3% on the closed test set. On the open test set, the WER is 38.6% and the PER is 11.8%. This shows that the system is able to achieve a relatively low error rate on the closed test set, but the performance degrades on the open test set. This is likely because the open test set contains more challenging data, such as noise and reverberation.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table5-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table4-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "2-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png", "2-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Transcribed data is available for duration of 38h 54m 38s for 8 speakers."}}
