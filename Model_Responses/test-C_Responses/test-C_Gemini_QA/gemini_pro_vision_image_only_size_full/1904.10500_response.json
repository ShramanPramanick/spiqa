From the confusion matrix, we can see that the model has difficulty in classifying the intent labels \"GoFaster\" and \"GoSlower\". This is likely because these two intents are very similar to each other, and the model is not able to distinguish between them. The model is also having difficulty classifying the intent label \"OpenDoor\". This is likely because this intent is not very common in the dataset, and the model does not have enough data to learn how to classify it correctly.'}", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure3-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "14-Table7-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "13-Table5-1.png", "9-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
