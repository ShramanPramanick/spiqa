Specifically, it focuses on core word diacritics in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Colloquial Arabic (CA). The materials detail features like case endings, POS tags, gender/number agreement, stem templates, prefixes and suffixes, and word morphology.  The research uses these features to develop a deep neural network (DNN) model for automatic diacritization and analyzes various types of errors encountered in the process.\"}", "all_figures_names": ["22-Table7-1.png", "15-Figure4-1.png", "20-Table5-1.png", "24-Table9-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table1-1.png", "10-Table2-1.png", "21-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "POS, gender/number and stem POS"}}
