In contrast, stable communities, like cooking or specific interests, exhibit high linguistic distinctiveness due to specialized jargon but lower user retention as the core topics remain consistent.\"}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
