For sentence similarity tasks like MedSTS and BIOSSES, Pearson correlation was used. For tasks like named entity recognition (NER) such as BC5CDR-disease, BC5CDR-chemical, and ShARe/CLEFE,  the F1 score was used.  Relation extraction tasks like DDI, ChemProt, and i2b2 used the micro F1 score, while i2b2 used the F1 score.  Document classification, exemplified by the HoC dataset, also used the F1 score.  Lastly, the MedNLI dataset, focusing on inference, used accuracy as its metric.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "BLUE utilizes different metrics for each of the tasks: Pearson correlation coefficient, F-1 scores, micro-averaging, and accuracy"}}
