This means the model can translate between language pairs it hasn\u2019t explicitly seen during training. This transfer learning capability is facilitated by the emergence of a continuous language space within the model, allowing it to generalize across languages and bridge the gap between unseen language pairs.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
