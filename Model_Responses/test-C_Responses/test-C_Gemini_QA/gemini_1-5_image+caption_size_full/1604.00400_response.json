{"534": {"question": "What different correlations result when using different variants of ROUGE scores?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Different variants of ROUGE scores produce varying degrees of correlation with human judgments. For instance, ROUGE-2 exhibits a higher correlation compared to ROUGE-1, as indicated by the Spearman correlation values in Table 2. Notably, ROUGE-SU variants, which account for unigrams and bigrams, demonstrate a stronger correlation with human evaluations than ROUGE-S variants that solely consider unigrams, as evidenced by the Kendall correlation values. This disparity in correlation arises from the specific aspects of text similarity that different ROUGE variants prioritize and emphasize.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
