There is no one typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synthesis. However, the context does introduce some popular GAN architectures like Conditional GAN, Manifold interpolation matching aware discriminator GAN, Auxiliary classifier GAN,  text conditioned auxiliary classifier GAN, and text conditioned semantic classifier GAN.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "21-Figure11-1.png", "18-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
