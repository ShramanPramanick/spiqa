{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': \"The provided captions describe various GAN architectures for text-to-image synthesis, but they don't specify a single 'typical' architecture for each group. The field encompasses a range of approaches, as highlighted in Caption 3, which categorizes them into Semantic Enhancement, Resolution Enhancement, Diversity Enhancement, and Motion Enhancement GANs. Each group likely employs different architectural modifications to achieve its specific goals.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on the captions:\n\n* **Caption 0 & 4:** Describe the fundamental GAN and conditional GAN architectures, laying the groundwork for text-to-image applications.\n* **Caption 2:**  Illustrates a general GAN-based text-to-image synthesis framework where text features are embedded and used alongside latent vectors to generate images.\n* **Caption 5:** Compares five GAN architectures (cGAN, GAN-INT-CLS, AC-GAN, TAC-GAN, Text-SeGAN) illustrating how they incorporate text input and differ in their outputs (e.g., discriminator, classifier).\n* **Caption 3:** Highlights the diversity of GAN frameworks, categorizing them based on their focus (semantic enhancement, resolution, diversity, motion).\n\nTherefore, instead of a 'typical' architecture for each group, the captions emphasize the existence of diverse GAN architectures tailored to address specific challenges and objectives within text-to-image synthesis.\"}\n", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure6-1.png", "22-Figure12-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
