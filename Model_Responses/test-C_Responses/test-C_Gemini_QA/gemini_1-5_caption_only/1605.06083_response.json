To answer your question, one would need more context or captions describing those methods. \n\nExamples of such methods could include:\n\n* **Word Embeddings Analysis:** Examining word associations within the dataset to identify potential biases.\n* **Classification Tasks:** Training classifiers to predict sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race) based on the captions and analyzing their performance.\n* **Human Evaluation:** Having human annotators review the captions and identify instances of bias or unwarranted inferences.'} \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Looking for adjectives marking the noun \"baby\" and also looking for most-common adjectives related to certain nouns using POS-tagging"}, "62": {"question": "What biases are found in the dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Answer': 'Although the provided captions do not give enough information to know what biases are found in the dataset, it mentions an analysis of the Flickr30K dataset focusing on how frequently ethnicity and race are mentioned in image captions.
