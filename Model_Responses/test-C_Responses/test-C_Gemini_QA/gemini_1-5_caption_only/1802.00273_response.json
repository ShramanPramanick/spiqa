This suggests they can learn to represent different languages in a way that facilitates transfer learning, potentially allowing them to translate between language pairs they haven't been explicitly trained on.'} \n", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
