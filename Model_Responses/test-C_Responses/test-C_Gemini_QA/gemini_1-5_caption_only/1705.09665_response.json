{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': 'The captions highlight that social phenomena like the acculturation gap, language distinctiveness and dynamism, and user retention manifest differently across diverse online communities. For instance, stable and highly dynamic communities, as well as those with distinctive language, tend to have larger acculturation gaps, implying stronger linguistic differentiation between established members and newcomers. Furthermore, communities with high language dynamism, such as those focused on sports teams, exhibit stronger user retention compared to communities with stable language, like cooking forums. Conversely, language distinctiveness, while contributing to a community\u2019s identity, doesn\u2019t show a significant correlation with long-term user retention.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
