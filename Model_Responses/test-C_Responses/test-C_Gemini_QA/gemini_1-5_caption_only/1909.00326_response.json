It appears they measure words under-translated by NMT models by: \\n\\n1. **Calculating word importance using Attribution (possibly integrated gradients).**\\n2. **Analyzing the correlation of this importance with factors like POS tags, Fertility (how many words a source word translates to), and Syntactic Depth.**\\n3. **Comparing the distribution of word importance with word count to identify discrepancies that suggest under-translation.** \\n\\nEssentially, if a word is deemed important by Attribution but is absent or has low importance based on its count or syntactic role in the translation, it might indicate under-translation by the NMT model.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "11-Table5-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
