The methods described, using NMT and SMT for translation enhancement, could likely be adapted to different technical fields with their own specific terminology. However, further details about the approach itself are needed for a concrete conclusion.'} \n", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "9-Figure6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png"], "answer": "There is no reason to think that this approach wouldn't also be successful for other technical domains.
