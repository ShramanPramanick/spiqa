For instance, 'Dynamicity' is a strong signal of higher user retention in communities, as seen in the monthly retention rate. On the other hand, 'Distinctiveness' does not correlate with longer-term user retention. This implies that while certain characteristics of a community might attract users initially, their ability to retain them over time may be influenced by other factors.</s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
