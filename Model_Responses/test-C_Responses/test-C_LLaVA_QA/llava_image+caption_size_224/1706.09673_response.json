The objective function is optimized to encourage understanding of literature as part of their overall goal. This is achieved by incorporating literature-related data and analyzing the relationships between different entities, such as authors, books, and genres. The model's structure allows for the identification of patterns and connections between these entities, ultimately helping to better understand the literature landscape."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "They group the existing works in terms of the objective function they optimize - within-tweet relationships, inter-tweet relationships, autoencoder, and weak supervision."}}
