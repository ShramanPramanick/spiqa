{"1459": {"question": "How much is performance hurt when using too small amount of layers in encoder?", "response": {"6-Table1-1.png": [" Yes", " The table shows the impact of increasing and decreasing the depth of the encoders and the decoder. When using too small an amount of layers in the encoder, the performance is hurt significantly. The table provides a comparison of the results with different encoder depths, and it is evident that using a smaller number of layers leads to a significant decrease in performance."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "comparing to the results from reducing the number of layers in the decoder, the BLEU score was 69.93 which is less than 1% in case of test2016 and in case of test2017 it was less by 0.2 %. In terms of TER it had higher score by 0.7 in case of test2016 and 0.1 in case of test2017. "}}
