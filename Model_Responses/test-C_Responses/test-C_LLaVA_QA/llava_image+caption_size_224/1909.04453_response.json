The table shows that the larger the lead, the more controllable the selector becomes, but it also means a bit of a decrease in performance. This is because the larger the lead, the more complex the model becomes, making it harder to optimize and maintain good performance."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table5-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
