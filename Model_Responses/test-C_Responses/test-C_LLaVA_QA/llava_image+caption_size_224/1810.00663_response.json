The results show that the model performed well on the test datasets, with the best results coming from the EM and GM models. The average edit distance for the ED model was also quite low, indicating that the model was able to accurately predict the correct output. Overall, the model appears to be effective in generating accurate results."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "For test-repeated set, EM score of 61.17, F1 of 93.54, ED of 0.75 and GM of 61.36.
