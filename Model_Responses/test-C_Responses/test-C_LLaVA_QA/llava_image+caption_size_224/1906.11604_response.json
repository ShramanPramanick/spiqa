This is done through a contextual gating mechanism in the decoder network."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer."}}
