The graph displays the monthly retention rate for each community, with dynamicity being the strongest signal of higher user retention. The graph also shows that dynamicity correlates with long-term user retention, measured as the number of months the average user spends in the community. However, distinctiveness does not correlate with this longer-term variant of user retention. The image"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
