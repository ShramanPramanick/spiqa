In other words, the difference in performance between the new embeddings and the previous embeddings is within a certain range, typically within 10% or less."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Performance was comparable, with the proposed method quite close and sometimes exceeding performance of baseline method."}}
