{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "response": {"2-Figure2-1.png": ["No", "A confusion network or lattice is a type of network or structure used in artificial intelligence and computer science. It is designed to process and analyze data in a way that is more efficient and accurate than traditional methods. The image shows a diagram of a confusion network, which consists of multiple circles connected by lines. These circles represent different data points or features, and the lines represent the connections between them. The goal of a confusion network is to process this data in a way that allows for more accurate analysis and prediction."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
