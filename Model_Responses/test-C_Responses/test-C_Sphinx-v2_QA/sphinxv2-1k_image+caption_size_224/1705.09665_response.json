{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "response": {"5-Figure2-1.png": ["No", "Dynamicity and distinctiveness are the strongest predictors of short-term and long-term user retention, respectively, while the strength of these signals varies across the identity-based typology."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
