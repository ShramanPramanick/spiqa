This suggests that the methods are effective in improving robustness against adversarial examples without sacrificing performance on benign data."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Data augmentation (es)  improved Adv es by 20% comparing to baseline \nData augmentation (cs) improved Adv cs by 16.5% comparing to baseline\nData augmentation (cs+es) improved both Adv cs and Adv es by at least 10% comparing to baseline \nAll models show improvements over adversarial sets  \n"}}
