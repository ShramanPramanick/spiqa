The scores are given as percentages, with 100% indicating perfect similarity. To compare the two methods, one can look at the scores for each pair of country and capital names. If the proposed word embeddings have higher scores than Sindhi fastText word representations, it suggests that they perform better in capturing the semantic relationships between words.
