{"654": {"question": "What is the difference in performance between the interpretable system (e.g. vectors and cosine distance) and LSTM with ELMo system?", "response": {"3-Table1-1.png": ["Yes", "The interpretable system, which includes methods like edit distance and cosine swapping, has a lower accuracy compared to the LSTM with ELMo system. The LSTM with ELMo system achieves higher accuracy and better performance in terms of perplexity, loss at train, and loss (test). This suggests that the LSTM with ELMo system is more effective for this task than the interpretable system."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Accuracy of best interpretible system was 0.3945 while accuracy of LSTM-ELMo net was 0.6818."}}
