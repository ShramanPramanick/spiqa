The context embedding is generated by combining the sentence embedding with an external word embedding, which allows for better understanding and interpretation of the spoken words within the context of the entire sentence. This helps improve the accuracy of the speech recognition system in identifying and transcribing the spoken content."], "5-Figure2-1.png": ["Yes", "Sentence embeddings are incorporated into the speech recognition system through a gated embedding mechanism in the decoder network. This mechanism allows for the integration of three different embeddings: 1) conversational context, 2) previous word, and 3) current speech. The gated embedding mechanism helps to improve the accuracy of the speech recognition system by considering multiple sources of information during the decoding process."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer."}}
