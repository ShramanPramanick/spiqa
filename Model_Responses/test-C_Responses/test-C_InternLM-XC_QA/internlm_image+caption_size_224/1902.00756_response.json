This is done by an encoding module which takes a sequence of vector representations as inputs and outputs a transition matrix. The propagation module then uses this transition matrix to propagate hidden states from nodes to their neighbors. Finally, a classification module provides task-related predictions based on the node representations."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
