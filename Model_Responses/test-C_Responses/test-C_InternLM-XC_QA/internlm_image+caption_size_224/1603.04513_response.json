{"842": {"question": "How much gain does the model achieve with pretraining MVCNN?", "response": {"8-Table3-1.png": ["Yes", "The table shows that the model achieves a significant gain with pretraining MVCNN, as indicated by the improvements in performance across different setups. The use of pretrained word embeddings and fine-tuning during training leads to better results compared to randomly initialized word embeddings or keeping them static during training. This suggests that pretraining plays an important role in improving the performance of the CNN model."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "0.8 points on Binary; 0.7 points on Fine-Grained; 0.6 points on Senti140; 0.7 points on Subj"}}
