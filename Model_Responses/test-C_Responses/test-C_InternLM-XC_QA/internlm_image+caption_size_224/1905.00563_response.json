However, in general, adversarial training can help improve a model's accuracy by exposing it to a variety of inputs that are designed to be challenging or misleading. By doing so, the model becomes better equipped to handle real-world data that may contain noise or other anomalies."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["12-Table7-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
