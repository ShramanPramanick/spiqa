The SERA scores are discounted (DIS), using keyword query reformulation (KW), and using noun phrases for query reformulation (NP). The numbers in front of the SERA metrics indicate the rank cut-off point. This suggests that different variants of ROUGE scores can result in varying correlations with SERA scores depending on the specific variant used and the rank cut-off point."]}, "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
