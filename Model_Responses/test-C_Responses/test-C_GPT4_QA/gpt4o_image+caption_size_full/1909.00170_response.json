For instance, Images 1 and 2 explicitly mention NE (Named Entity) and NE extraction, Image 3 refers to F1 scores on CoNLL-2003 and ONTONOTES 5.0 datasets which are common NER benchmarks, and Image 6 compares state-of-the-art systems on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, again a known NER dataset. Therefore, it is clear that they evaluate on NER data sets.\n\n{'Answer': 'Yes'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png", "6-Table5-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Table7-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table7-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
