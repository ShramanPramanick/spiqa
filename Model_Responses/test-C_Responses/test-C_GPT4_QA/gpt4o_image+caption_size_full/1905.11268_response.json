The key strategies analyzed are Pass-Through, Background, and Neutral. The Background strategy shows the lowest word error rates (WER) and reasonable sensitivity values, while the Neutral strategy exhibits the lowest sensitivity but higher WER. Pass-Through strategy usually results in moderate error rates and sensitivities. These strategies enhance the performance of word recognition models by effectively balancing between sensitivity and accuracy under various types of adversarial attacks.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "In pass-through, the recognizer passes on the possibly misspelled word, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "748": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'Backoff strategies work by incorporating different models or methods to handle potential adversarial inputs or out-of-vocabulary words in word recognition systems.
