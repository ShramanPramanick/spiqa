Dynamic communities like Seahawks have highly variable content over time, leading to high user retention but a smaller acculturation gap. Consistent communities like Cooking experience less variation in content, with stable user retention and larger acculturation gaps. Communities that are distinctive in their language, such as yugioh, display larger acculturation gaps and higher user retention rates. Generally, high dynamicity is associated with both short-term and long-term user retention, whereas distinctiveness primarily influences short-term retention and the extent of linguistic differentiation between", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
