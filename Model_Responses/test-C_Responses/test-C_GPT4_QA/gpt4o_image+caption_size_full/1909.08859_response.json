In single-task training, PRN achieves the highest average accuracy (57.57) and performs best in the cloze (56.31) and ordering (62.77) tasks. In multi-task training, PRN shows a balanced performance, particularly in the coherence and ordering tasks, scoring 50.17 overall.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Average accuracy of proposed model vs best prevous result:\nSingle-task Training: 57.57 vs 55.06\nMulti-task Training: 50.17 vs 50.59"}}
