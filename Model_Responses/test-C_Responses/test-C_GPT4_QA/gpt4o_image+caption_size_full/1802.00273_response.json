They can also utilize multilingual training data embedded in a shared vector space to perform transfer learning, allowing them to translate between languages even without direct training on specific language pairs, as seen in zero-shot translation scenarios.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
