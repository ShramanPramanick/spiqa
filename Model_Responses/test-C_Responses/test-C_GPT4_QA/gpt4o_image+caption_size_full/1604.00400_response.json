{"534": {"question": "What different correlations result when using different variants of ROUGE scores?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'Different variants of ROUGE scores result in different correlations with the pyramid scores: ROUGE-1 shows a moderate correlation with Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall measures, while ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-3 show higher correlations across these measures. Specifically, ROUGE-3-F achieves the highest correlation scores (Pearson r = 0.878, Spearman \u03c1 = 0.841, Kendall \u03c4 = 0.690). These correlations vary in strength depending on whether Precision (P), Recall (R), or F-score (F) is used, with F-scores generally showing stronger correlations.'", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
