Semantic Enhancement GANs: These models aim to improve the alignment between the text description and the semantic content of the generated images. Examples include GAN-INT-CLS and DCGAN which utilize text descriptions to refine image details during generation.\n\n2. Resolution Enhancement GANs: These GAN architectures work on producing higher resolution images that remain consistent with the text input. StackGAN and StackGAN++ are notable examples that use a multi-stage generation", "all_figures_names": ["20-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "8-Figure6-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "22-Figure12-1.png", "10-Figure8-1.png", "18-Table1-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
