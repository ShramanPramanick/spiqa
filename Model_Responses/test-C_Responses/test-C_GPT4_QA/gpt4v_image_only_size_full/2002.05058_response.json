According to the images provided, specifically Image 2 and Image 5, the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients for \"our approach\" with skill rating are higher in comparison to other metrics like ADEM, Adversarial Evaluator, BLEU, and Perplexity. For the Dialogue task, the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.764 and 0.783 respectively when trained with the proposed metric including skill ratings, which are substantially higher than those achieved with the other mentioned metrics.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Pearson correlation to human judgement - proposed vs next best metric\nSample level comparison:\n- Story generation: 0.387 vs 0.148\n- Dialogue: 0.472 vs 0.341\nModel level comparison:\n- Story generation:  0.631 vs 0.302\n- Dialogue: 0.783 vs 0.553"}}
