There are different metrics used to assess these models, such as BLEU score, BPRA (Binary Precision-Recall AUC), and APRA (Average Precision-Recall AUC), as well as time taken for full evaluation (T_time", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "most of the models have similar performance on BPRA: DSTC2 (+0.0015), Maluuba (+0.0729)\nGDP achieves the best performance in APRA: DSTC2 (+0.2893), Maluuba (+0.2896)\nGDP significantly outperforms the baselines on BLEU: DSTC2 (+0.0791), Maluuba (+0.0492)"}}
