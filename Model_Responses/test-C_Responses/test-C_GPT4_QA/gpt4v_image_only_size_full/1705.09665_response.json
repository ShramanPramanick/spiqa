{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{\n  'Answer': 'The images suggest that social phenomena manifest in communities with varying degrees of dynamism and distinctiveness. Communities with high dynamism seem to have a higher rate of user retention and show more variability in the topics discussed over time. Distinctive communities, on the other hand, have more specific and unique content, which may also affect user retention and engagement. Additionally, the acculturation gap, which may indicate the ease of new users integrating into the community, varies with these factors. The combination of dynamism and distinctiveness seems to categorize communities into types such as \"generic dynamic,\" \"distinctive dynamic,\"", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
