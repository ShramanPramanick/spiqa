{"1032": {"question": "Do sluice networks outperform non-transfer learning approaches?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "Based on the provided images, it appears that sluice networks generally do outperform non-transfer learning approaches in various tasks. Here is a summary of the findings from the images:\n\n- Image 0 shows that sluice networks with learned task sharing and layer sharing perform better on average across different domains than configurations with constant task sharing (hard parameter sharing).\n- Image 2 illustrates that in terms of specific tasks like CHUNK, NER, SRL, and POS, the performance of sluice networks is competitive with and in some cases slightly better than single task and other baseline approaches.\n- Image 3 demonstrates that sluice networks outperform several bas", "all_figures_names": ["9-Table6-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "10-Figure3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "10-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
