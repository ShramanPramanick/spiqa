For instance, in the provided images, one can observe that a model variant with a reduced number of layers (6-6-4) achieves lower BLEU and TER scores compared to a variant with a standard or higher number of layers.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "comparing to the results from reducing the number of layers in the decoder, the BLEU score was 69.93 which is less than 1% in case of test2016 and in case of test2017 it was less by 0.2 %.
