The provided images suggest that models incorporating visual information, such as ImageVec and MUSE with image grounding, generally outperform their counterparts without this visual grounding, as indicated by higher scores in various multilingual evaluations.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "performance is significantly degraded without pixel data"}}
