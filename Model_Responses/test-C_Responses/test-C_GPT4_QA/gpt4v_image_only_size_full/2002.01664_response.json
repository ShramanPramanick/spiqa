{"99": {"question": "What is the GhostVLAD approach?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'The GhostVLAD approach is a variant of the NetVLAD pooling method designed to aggregate feature descriptors for tasks like image retrieval or place recognition. It improves upon NetVLAD by introducing so-called \"ghost\" clusters that are used during training to act as distractors, which helps reduce the influence of noisy or irrelevant data when computing the VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) representation. GhostVLAD has been shown to achieve higher performance than other pooling methods, as indicated by its F1-Score in comparison results.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content."}, "100": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam"}, "101": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': 'Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali,  English and Assamese (in table, missing in text)"}}
