{"654": {"question": "What is the difference in performance between the interpretable system (e.g. vectors and cosine distance) and LSTM with ELMo system?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'The LSTM-ElMo system has the highest accuracy at 0.6818 compared to the vector distance method (interpretable system) which has an accuracy of 0.3945. The LSTM with ELMo also has lower loss on both training (0.07) and test (0.38) datasets than the LSTM-1 net (0.3 train, 0.41 test), indicating improved performance. The perplexity of the LSTM-ElMo system is significantly higher at 706166 compared to LSTM-1 net's 907, suggesting that it may be overfitting despite its higher", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Accuracy of best interpretible system was 0.3945 while accuracy of LSTM-ELMo net was 0.6818."}}
