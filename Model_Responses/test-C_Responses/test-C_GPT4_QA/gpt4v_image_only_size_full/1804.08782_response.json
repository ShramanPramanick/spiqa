{"1009": {"question": "How do they correlate NED with emotional bond levels?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'The images indicate that NED (presumably a measure or metric) is inversely correlated with emotional bond levels. Specifically, Image 0 shows Pearson's correlation coefficients (\u03c1) where NED-TP has a \u03c1 of -0.1317 and NED-PT has a \u03c1 of -0.4479. Lower correlation coefficient values indicate less similarity or direct relationship between the measures, and since they are negative, this suggests an inverse relationship. Additionally, the p-value for NED-PT is 0.0095, which is less than the typical alpha level of 0.05,", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "They compute Pearson\u2019s correlation between NED measure for patient-to-therapist and patient-perceived emotional bond rating and NED measure for therapist-to-patient and patient-perceived emotional bond rating"}}
