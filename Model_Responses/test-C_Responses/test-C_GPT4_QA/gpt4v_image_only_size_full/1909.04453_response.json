The provided graphs and tables from the images indicate that increased control can lead to higher performance in certain scenarios, as seen by improved evaluation metrics like ROUGE scores (R-1, R-2, R-L) and BLEU scores for specific approaches (VRS) when more control is applied (posterior selection with epsilon values).'}", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "15-Table7-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "8-Table6-1.png", "14-Figure5-1.png", "13-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table5-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
