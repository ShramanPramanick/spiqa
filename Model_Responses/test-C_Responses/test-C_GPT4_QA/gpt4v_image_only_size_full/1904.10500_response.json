We can see that the counts vary, with 'SetRoute' having the highest count at 676 and 'OpenDoor' having the lowest at 142. This shows that the dataset does have an imbalance in terms of the number of utterances per intent.\n\nImage 5 provides additional statistics for slot count and keyword count,", "all_figures_names": ["14-Table7-1.png", "8-Figure3-1.png", "13-Table4-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "11-Figure6-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "10-Figure5-1.png", "13-Table5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
