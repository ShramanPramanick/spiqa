Additionally, architectures that combine CNNs for visual feature extraction with LSTM-based language models for sequence prediction are also considered advanced, as depicted in the diagram showing the integration of a CNN with forward, backward, and merge units feeding into a sentence unit for generating descriptions.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "S2VT, RGB (VGG), RGB (VGG)+Flow (AlexNet), LSTM-E (VGG), LSTM-E (C3D) and Yao et al."}}
