They thought this was a good idea likely because the proposed models and methods shown demonstrate improvements over other models, as indicated by the evaluations in the figures. The use of techniques like seq2seq models, coverage mechanisms, and data comparisons suggests an effort to enhance the accuracy and quality of translations or summaries, making the research beneficial for applications that require automated text processing.'}", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table6-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["1-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They think it will help human TCM practitioners make prescriptions."}}
