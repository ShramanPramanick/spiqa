The relevant image here is Image 2, which shows the architecture of a model.\n\nImage 2 depicts a model consisting of several components. From bottom to top:\n1. Word Embedding Transformation layer (green boxes)\n2. Convolution layers with multiple filters (orange boxes)\n3. Maximum Pooling (light blue boxes next to Convolution)\n4. Average Pooling (purple box at the very top)\n5.
