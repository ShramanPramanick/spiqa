Image 1 and Image 5 contain tables that show results under two conditions: Training Simulation (Train. Sim.) and Evaluation Simulation (Eval. Sim.), divided into outcomes related to reward (Rew.) and success (Suc.).\n\nThe most direct comparison between NUS and ABUS can be made by looking at the \"Eval. Sim.\" columns for both NUS and ABUS, comparing the \"Suc.\" (Success) rates, since this seems to be the relevant metric.\n\nFrom Image 1:\n- The", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Average success rate is higher by 2.6 percent points."}}
