Specifically, I will look at the performance metrics of different systems on discourse relation tasks, such as implicit and explicit relation recognition, which are often divided into different types such as Comparison (Comp), Contingency (Cont), Expansion (Exp), and Temporal (Temp) relations.\n\nBased on Image 4, when comparing the \"Basic System (\u03b1 = 1)\" with the system \"+ Untie Parameters,\" there is an improvement across all four types of discourse relations when", "all_figures_names": ["9-Figure4-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Best: Expansion (Exp).
