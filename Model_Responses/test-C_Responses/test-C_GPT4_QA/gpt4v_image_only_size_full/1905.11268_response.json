{"747": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Answer': 'Backoff strategies are methods used in natural language processing to handle situations where a language model encounters words or phrases that are not in its training data (out-of-vocabulary issues) or to improve robustness against input perturbations like typos or adversarial alterations. Common backoff strategies include pass-through, neutral, and background methods. The pass-through strategy allows the model to attempt to process the unknown word as is, potentially using contextual clues to infer meaning. The neutral strategy replaces the unknown word with a neutral element that does not contribute to the meaning of the sentence, while the background strategy substitutes the unknown word with a", "all_figures_names": ["1-Table1-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "In pass-through, the recognizer passes on the possibly misspelled word, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "748": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Answer': 'Backoff strategies are techniques used to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or data that the model has not seen before. When a model encounters an unknown word or a perturbed input that it cannot process, a backoff strategy allows the model to revert to a simpler or more generalized form of processing to make a decision.
