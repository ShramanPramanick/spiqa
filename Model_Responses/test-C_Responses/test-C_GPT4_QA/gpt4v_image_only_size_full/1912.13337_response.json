The images display structured data (such as triples and graphs), templates for question generation, and performance evaluation metrics of different models.\n\nQuality control measures can be implied based on the quantitative data depicted in one of the images, showing evaluation scores for different models, which suggests a systematic approach to assessing the dataset's applicability and the model's understanding of the probes.
