The performance is measured by numbers which likely represent accuracy or some kind of performance metric. Considering model variations like \"1MP\", \"2MP\", and so on, this suggests multiple passes or message-passing steps that may impact performance.\n\nImage 1 provides statistics about different datasets, including", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table3-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Increasing number of message passing iterations showed consistent improvement in performance - around 1 point improvement compared between 1 and 4 iterations"}}
