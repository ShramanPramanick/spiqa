{"543": {"question": "how is mitigation of gender bias evaluated?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Mitigation of gender bias is evaluated using statistical and computational methods that quantify the bias in language models or algorithms. In the given images, gender bias is quantified in two ways: occupation bias conditioned on gendered words and occupation bias conditioned on occupations. Different metrics such as log probability ratios are used to measure the bias. Moreover, multiple models are evaluated with varying parameters and debiasing techniques as shown in the second image, where various metrics such as \\( B^N \\), \\( B^N_c \\), GR, \\( P_{pl} \\), \\( CB_{lo} \\), \\( CB_{lg}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1"}}
