Agglutinative languages are characterized by their morphology, where words often contain a linear sequence of distinct morphemes that are relatively easily separable and interpretable. Some agglutinative languages might use both prefixes and suffixes, but the images provided do not contain specific information to confirm their role in predictions for other languages.'}", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "7-Table7-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "6-Table5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table7-1.png", "5-Table4-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "323": {"question": "How is the performance on the task evaluated?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'The provided images do not contain sufficient context or a clear methodology that would allow me to determine how the performance on the task is evaluated.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table5-1.png", "5-Table4-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "7-Table7-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table4-1.png"], "answer": "Comparison of test accuracies of neural network models on an inflection task and qualitative analysis of the errors"}}
