They show the impact of damaging different neural modules on task performance. The first image illustrates that damaging LSTMs and the Lexicon Unit results in lower precision in various language tasks, such as GEO (Geography questions), WSJ10 (Wall Street Journal Sentence Simplification), and English to Mandarin translation. The second image seems to be a schematic of a neural model architecture, but does not provide direct evidence on module damage. The third image further corroborates that LSTM models, when damaged, perform worse in tasks than models with no damage,", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Damage to neural modules is done by randomly initializing their weights, causing the loss of all learned information."}}
