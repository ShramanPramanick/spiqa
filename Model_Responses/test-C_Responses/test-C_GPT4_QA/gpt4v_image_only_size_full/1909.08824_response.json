Since the question asks for \"how much they improve,\" we should look for the method that represents the state-of-the-art (SOTA) improvements in the relevant metrics. In this case, it appears that the method \"CWVAE\" is being compared against other methods such as \"RNN-based Seq2Seq,\" \"Variational Seq2Seq,\" and \"VRNMT.\"\n\nWithout knowing the exact context and what is considered the baseline state-of-the-art method, it might be challenging to give a specific number", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table4-1.png", "6-Table5-1.png", "7-Table7-1.png", "8-Table10-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "2-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table4-1.png", "7-Table6-1.png"], "answer": "ON Event2Mind, the accuracy of proposed method is improved by  absolute BLUE  2.9,  10.87, 1.79 for xIntent, xReact and oReact respectively.\nOn Atomic dataset, the accuracy of proposed method is improved by  absolute BLUE 3.95.   4.11, 4.49 for xIntent, xReact and oReact.respectively."}}
