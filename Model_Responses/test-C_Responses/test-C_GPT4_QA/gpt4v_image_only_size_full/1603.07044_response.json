Examples could consist of tasks that involve relevancy determination (like judging if a piece of information is relevant to a query), ranking tasks (ordering items by relevance or importance), and feature augmentation tasks (where additional features are created to improve the model's predictions). These tasks are designed to leverage shared representations or features that are beneficial across the related tasks to enhance learning and generalization.'}", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "Multitask learning is used for the task of predicting relevance of a comment on a different question to a given question, where the supplemental tasks are predicting relevance between the questions, and between the comment and the corresponding question"}, "195": {"question": "How much performance gap between their approach and the strong handcrafted method?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "{'Answer': 'The performance gap between their approach and the strong handcrafted method varies by task.
