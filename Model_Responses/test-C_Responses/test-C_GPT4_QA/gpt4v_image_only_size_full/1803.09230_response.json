{"706": {"question": "By how much, the proposed method improves BiDAF and DCN on SQuAD dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "Based on the data provided in the input images, specifically Image 4, we can compare the F1 and EM (Exact Match) scores of the models (BiDAF and DCN which seems to be referred to as DCA based on context clues) to the proposed method (likely to be Hybrid based on Image 4). Here's the comparison:\n\nFor BiDAF:\n- The F1 score increased from 47.48% for BiDAF to 70.95% for the proposed method (Hybrid).\n- The EM score increased from 38.62% for BiDAF to 60.54%", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table4-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "In terms of F1 score, the Hybrid approach improved by 23.47% and 1.39% on BiDAF and DCN respectively. The DCA approach improved by 23.2% and 1.12% on BiDAF and DCN respectively."}}
