{"1392": {"question": "How are sentence embeddings incorporated into the speech recognition system?", "referred_figures_indices": [5, 4], "response": "{'Answer': 'Sentence embeddings are incorporated into the speech recognition system by providing contextual information that helps in understanding the meaning of the utterances. Specifically, embeddings such as fastText or BERT can be used to create a context vector that captures conversational context from previous utterances. This context vector is then combined with word embeddings and acoustic features to improve the performance of the speech recognition system, as depicted in the diagrams from the provided images. The gated embedding mechanism shown illustrates how the context embedding is blended with other embeddings before being fed into the decoder to generate the recognized speech. Performance metrics in the provided tables show that incorporating conversational context using", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "BERT generates sentence embeddings that represent words in context. These sentence embeddings are merged into a single conversational-context vector that is used to calculate a gated embedding and is later combined with the output of the decoder h to provide the gated activations for the next hidden layer."}}
