{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Neural machine translation models can learn to perform multilingual translation, encapsulating diverse linguistic knowledge from various languages into a single model. This can include the ability to perform \"zero-shot\" translation, where the model translates between language pairs it has not been directly trained on, by understanding and mapping the semantics of the source and target languages into a shared vector space. Transfer learning in neural machine translation leverages shared linguistic features across languages, allowing for more efficient learning and generalization to new languages.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
