However, there is no explicit mention of evaluating the grammaticality of the generated text. The images show statistical results, model architectures, and comparison of word associations, but they do not directly address the evaluation of grammatical correctness.'}", "all_figures_names": ["10-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure1-1.png", "11-Table3-1.png", "12-Table6-1.png", "14-Table9-1.png", "14-Table8-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png", "13-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["10-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
