These benefits include the ability to capture the dependence of nodes without needing any pre-defined sequence or grid structure, leveraging node connectivity directly, and often having fewer parameters leading to faster training times. However, attention mechanisms provide a different set of advantages such as the flexibility to dynamically focus on different parts of the data, which can be particularly useful in non-graph structured data or when modeling long-range dependencies.", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "10-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "9-Table5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
