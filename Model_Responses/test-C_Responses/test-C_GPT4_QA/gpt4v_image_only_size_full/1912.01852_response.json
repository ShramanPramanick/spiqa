The provided images indicate the use of machine learning models to analyze and reconstruct singing voices, assessing qualities such as pitch and timbre. Objective metrics may include measurements of pitch accuracy, dynamics, and timbral consistency, while subjective assessments could involve ratings of naturalness and similarity to a target voice. These are often evaluated using methods like normalised cross-correlation (NCC) scores for objective similarity, and human listener ratings on scales for subjective qualities.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Automatic: Normalized cross correlation (NCC)\nManual: Mean Opinion Score (MOS)"}}
