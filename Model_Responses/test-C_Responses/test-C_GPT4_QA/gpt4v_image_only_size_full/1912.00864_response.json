{"1136": {"question": "How much more accurate is the model than the baseline?", "referred_figures_indices": [0, 3, 5], "response": "To determine how much more accurate the model is than the baseline, we need to compare the performance metrics for the models presented in the tables from the images. Since there is no explicit reference to what the baseline model is, I will consider the baseline to be the model(s) other than NAGM that are present in the evaluations.\n\nThe images provided contain tables with various metrics, such as ROUGE-L and BLEU-4, which are common scores used for evaluating the performance of models that generate text. Higher scores indicate better performance. For the purpose of this answer, let's consider the most frequently appearing model other than NAGM", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table7-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table7-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png"], "answer": "For the Oshiete-goo dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, Trans, by 0.021, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.037.  For the nfL6 dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, CLSTM, by 0.028, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.040. Human evaluation of the NAGM's generated outputs for the Oshiete-goo dataset had 47% ratings of (1), the highest rating, while CLSTM only received 21% ratings of (1). For the nfL6 dataset, the comparison of (1)'s was NAGM's 50% to CLSTM's 30%. "}}
