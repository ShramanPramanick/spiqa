{"463": {"question": "How does proposed word embeddings compare to Sindhi fastText word representations?", "referred_figures_indices": [2, 4], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Image 2 presents a comparison of different word representations, including SdFastText and other embeddings like CBoW, SG, and GloVe, which directly answers the question.'}\n\nThe answer is: The proposed word embeddings generally show lower cosine similarity scores compared to Sindhi fastText word representations (SdfastText). On average, the SdfastText scores higher than the proposed embeddings in recognizing semantic relationships between word pairs. This indicates that for the Sindhi language, the fastText model has better performance in capturing word relationships compared to other proposed embeddings like CBoW,", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure1-1.png", "12-Figure3-1.png", "15-Table7-1.png", "14-Table6-1.png", "15-Table8-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "17-Figure6-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["15-Table7-1.png", "15-Table8-1.png"], "answer": "Proposed SG model vs SINDHI FASTTEXT:\nAverage cosine similarity score: 0.650 vs 0.388\nAverage semantic relatedness similarity score between countries and their capitals: 0.663 vs 0.391"}, "465": {"question": "How many uniue words are in the dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Image 3 provides complete statistics of the collected corpus, including the number of unique words, which answers the question directly.'}\n\nThe answer is: 908,456", "all_figures_names": ["15-Table7-1.png", "5-Figure1-1.png", "17-Figure4-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "17-Figure5-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png", "14-Table6-1.png", "12-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "908456 unique words are available in collected corpus."}}
