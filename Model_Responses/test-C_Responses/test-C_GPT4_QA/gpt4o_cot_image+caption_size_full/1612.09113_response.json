The architecture includes shared layers for SENNA word embeddings which further branch into POS embedding, chunk embedding, and finally language modeling.", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "The network architecture has a multi-task Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Network, with an unsupervised sequence labeling task and a low-dimensional embedding layer between tasks. There is a hidden layer after each successive task with skip connections to the senior supervised layers."}}
