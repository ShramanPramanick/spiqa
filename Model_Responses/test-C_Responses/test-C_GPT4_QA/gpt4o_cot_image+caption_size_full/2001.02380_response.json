{"795": {"question": "Are some models evaluated using this metric, what are the findings?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 provides a detailed table (Table 5) showing model performance metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) for various relations, which is directly relevant for evaluating models and their findings.'}\n\nThe answer is: Yes, some models are evaluated using this metric. The findings indicate varied performance across different relations, with overall precision, recall, and F1-score being 44.37. Specific relations like \"Condition\" and \"Preparation\" have higher performance, while others like \"Antithesis\" and \"Justify\" have very low or zero performance.", "all_figures_names": ["14-Table5-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "19-Figure6-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png", "13-Figure4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "22-Table6-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["13-Figure4-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
