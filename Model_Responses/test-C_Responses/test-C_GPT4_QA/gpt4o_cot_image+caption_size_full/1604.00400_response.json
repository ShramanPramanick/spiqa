{"534": {"question": "What different correlations result when using different variants of ROUGE scores?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 provides a comprehensive table showing the correlation metrics (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) between various ROUGE score variants and SERA metrics, directly addressing the question about correlations of different ROUGE score variants.'}\n\nThe answer is: Different variants of ROUGE scores result in different correlations when compared with SERA metrics and human pyramid scores. For example, the ROUGE-3-F score shows high correlation across all three metrics (Pearson: 0.878, Spearman: 0.841, Kendall: 0.69), whereas other variants such as RO", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
