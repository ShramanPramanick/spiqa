For example, a triple like (educated_at, x, y) can be associated with questions such as \"Where did x graduate from?\" or \"What is x's alma mater?\" The task then involves filling in the value (y) based on the", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["1-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "The relation R(x,y) is mapped onto a question q whose answer is y"}}
