{"662": {"question": "How do they measure which words are under-translated by NMT models?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Image': 4, 'Rationale': 'Image 4 is most helpful because it directly compares the accuracy of different methods (Attention, Erasure, and Attribution) in detecting under-translation errors in NMT models using word importance.'}\n\nThe answer is: They measure which words are under-translated by NMT models using methods like Attention, Erasure, and Attribution to estimate word importance and detect under-translation errors. These methods help identify words that are more likely to be under-translated based on their importance scores, with Attribution providing the highest F1 accuracy in detecting such errors.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "11-Table5-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "11-Table6-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
