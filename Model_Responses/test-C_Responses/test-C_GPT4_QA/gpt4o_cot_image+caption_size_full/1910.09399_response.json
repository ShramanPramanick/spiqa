{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'The conceptual view of the conditional GAN architecture directly explains the components and process of a typical GAN used for text-to-image synthesis, which is essential to answer the question about typical GAN architectures.'}\n\nThe answer is : A typical GAN architecture for text-to-image synthesis generally includes a Generator (G) that creates images based on a random noise vector and a condition vector (in this case, text). These generated images are then fed to a Discriminator (D) alongside real images, and the Discriminator's role is to differentiate between real and fake images. The process involves iterative training of both", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure6-1.png", "21-Figure11-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "20-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "18-Table1-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "22-Figure12-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
