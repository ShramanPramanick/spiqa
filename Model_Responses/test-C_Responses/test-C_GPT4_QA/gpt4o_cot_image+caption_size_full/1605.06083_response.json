For example, descriptions for Asian individuals are given with ethnic markers 60% of the time, while for Black individuals, it's 40%, and for White individuals, it's 20%. This disparity suggests a potential bias in the way different ethnicities/races are described or highlighted in the dataset.", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Ethnic bias"}}
