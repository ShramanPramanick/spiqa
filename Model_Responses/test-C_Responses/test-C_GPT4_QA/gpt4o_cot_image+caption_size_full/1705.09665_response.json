This helps explain how social phenomena manifest in diverse community types.'}\n\nThe answer is: Social phenomena in different types of communities manifest through varying degrees of distinctiveness and dynamicity in language use. Communities like Seahawks and Cooking exhibit high distinctiveness in their language, while communities like BabyBumps and pics show varied levels of specific language that remains either consistent or changes over time. These variations affect user retention rates, indicating that", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
