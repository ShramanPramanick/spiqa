Common backoff strategies include Pass-Through, Neutral, and Background. Each strategy impacts the Word Error Rates differently; for example, the Background strategy tends to show lower error rates in various scenarios (such as Swap, Drop, Add, Key, and All), indicating robust", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure2-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "In pass-through, the recognizer passes on the possibly misspelled word, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "748": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'Image 2 contains a table showing Word Error Rates (WER) with different backoff strategies, which helps in understanding how these strategies operate and perform.'}\n\nThe answer is: Backoff strategies are techniques used in language models to handle words that are out-of-vocabulary (OOV). The common backoff strategies include Pass-Through, Neutral, and Background. Pass-Through simply uses the existing model without modification; Neutral leverages a middle ground, and Background uses a model trained on a larger, more diverse dataset.

The effectiveness of these strategies is analyzed based on parameters like sensitivity and word recognition error rates.
