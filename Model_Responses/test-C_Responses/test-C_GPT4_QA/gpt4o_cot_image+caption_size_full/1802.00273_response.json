{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 shows the experimental setup for multilingual NMT with specific reference to language embeddings and learning translation across different pairs, illustrating the concepts of transfer learning.'}\n\nThe answer is: Neural machine translation (NMT) models can leverage transfer learning to improve their ability to translate between languages by using common embeddings for multiple languages, enabling them to learn shared representations. This allows knowledge gained from translating one language pair to be transferred to another pair, even facilitating translations between language pairs that were not seen during training (zero-shot translation).", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
