{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 6, 'Rationale': 'This image directly shows the structure of a confusion network and a word lattice, which visually explains what they are.'}\n\nThe answer is: A confusion network (or lattice) is a graphical representation used in speech recognition and natural language processing. It shows different possible outputs (words or phrases) for a given input, with probabilities assigned to each possible path or arc. The word lattice represents multiple hypotheses in a compact form, and confusion networks are a condensed form of word lattices that align different hypotheses to facilitate easy comparison and selection of the best possible result.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
