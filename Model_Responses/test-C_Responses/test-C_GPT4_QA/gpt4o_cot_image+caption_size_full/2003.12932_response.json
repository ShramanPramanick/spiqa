With no errors, the correlation is 0.89 (10 epochs) and 0.9 (50 epochs). With maximum errors (20%), the correlation drops to 0.29 (10 epochs) and 0.35 (50 epochs).", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure4-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure5-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure5-1.png"], "answer": "10 Epochs: pearson-Spearman correlation  drops  60 points when error increase by 20%\n50 Epochs: pearson-Spearman correlation  drops  55 points when error increase by 20%"}, "1064": {"question": "Which sentiment analysis data set has a larger performance drop when a 10% error is introduced?", "referred_figures_indices": [5, 6], "response": "{'Image': 5, 'Rationale': 'This image shows the performance metrics (F1 score) versus different percentages of error for the SST-2 sentiment analysis dataset, which directly answers the question about the performance drop when a 10% error is introduced.'}\n\nThe answer is: The SST-2 dataset has a larger performance drop (from 0.84 to 0.68, a drop of 0.16) when a 10% error is introduced.", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure5-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "SST-2 dataset"}}
