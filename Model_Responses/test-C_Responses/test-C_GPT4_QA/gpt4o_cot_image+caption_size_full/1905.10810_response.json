{"654": {"question": "What is the difference in performance between the interpretable system (e.g. vectors and cosine distance) and LSTM with ELMo system?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Table 1 contains performance metrics such as accuracy, perplexity, and loss for both interpretable systems like vector distance and an LSTM with ELMo system, which directly allows for comparison between them.'}\n\nThe answer is: The LSTM with ELMo system outperforms the interpretable system (e.g., vector distance) in terms of accuracy. The LSTM-ELMo net has an accuracy of 0.6818 while the vector distance method has an accuracy of 0.3945.
