Initially, the mixed objective performs worse as it begins policy learning from scratch, but it quickly outperforms the cross-entropy model.", "all_figures_names": ["6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "The mixed objective improves EM by 2.5% and F1 by 2.2%"}}
