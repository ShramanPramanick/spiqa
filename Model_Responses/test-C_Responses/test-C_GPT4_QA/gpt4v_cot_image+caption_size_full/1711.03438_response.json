{"1439": {"question": "Can the model add new relations to the knowledge graph, or just new entities?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Illustration of the model process which is relevant for understanding its capabilities with knowledge graphs.'}\n\nThe answer is: The model can add new relationships to the knowledge graph as well as new entities. It's not limited to just adding new entities; it is designed for open-world knowledge graph completion, which includes predicting new links (relations) between entities and possibly adding missing entities. The ConMask model, as illustrated in Image 3, combines various pieces of information (e.g., head entity description, relationship name, tail entity description) to predict missing parts of the knowledge graph, which includes", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table2-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "The model does not add new relations to the knowledge graph."}}
