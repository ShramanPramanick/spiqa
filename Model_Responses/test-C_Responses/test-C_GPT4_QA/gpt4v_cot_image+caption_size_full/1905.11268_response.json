For example, in the context of a spell-correcting recurrent neural network (ScRNN), different backoff strategies might include \"Pass-Through,\" \"Neutral,\" and \"Background.\" These strategies influence how the model responds to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or errors.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "8-Table5-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "Pass-through passes the possibly misspelled word as is, backoff to neutral word backs off to a word with similar distribution across classes and backoff to background model backs off to a more generic word recognition model trained with larger and less specialized corpus."}, "749": {"question": "How do the backoff strategies work?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This image directly depicts word error rates with various backoff strategies, which is helpful in understanding how different backoff strategies perform.'}\n\nThe answer is: Backoff strategies like Pass-Through, Neutral, and Background in speech or text recognition systems serve as techniques to handle situations where the system encounters unknown or out-of-vocabulary words. Pass-Through typically allows the unrecognized word to pass through as is, possibly marking it as unknown.
