{"534": {"question": "What different correlations result when using different variants of ROUGE scores?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 provides a comprehensive table with various ROUGE metrics and their correlation to human pyramid scores, helping us understand the different correlations resulting from using different ROUGE score variants.'}\n\nThe answer is: Different variants of ROUGE scores result in varying correlations with human pyramid scores. For instance, ROUGE-1-F, ROUGE-1-P, and ROUGE-1-R show relatively lower correlations across all three metrics (Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall) compared to ROUGE-2-F and ROUGE-3-F, which show higher correlations.
