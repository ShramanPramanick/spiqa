For small-scale datasets, there are labels such as positive, negative, and neutral, each with separate counts. For example, the Book domain in Set 1 has 2000 each of positive, negative, and neutral labels. The large-scale datasets also follow a similar pattern, with different counts for positive, negative, and neutral labels, with total label counts provided for each", "all_figures_names": ["12-Table4-1.png", "9-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "11-Table3-1.png", "13-Table5-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "14-Table6-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Book, Electronics, Beauty and Music each have 6000, IMDB 84919, Yelp 231163, Cell Phone 194792 and Baby 160792 labeled data."}, "162": {"question": "What are the source and target domains?", "referred_figures_indices": [2, 7], "response": "{'Image': 7, 'Rationale': 'The table lists source (S) and target (T) domain abbreviations, helping to deduce the source and target domains.'}\n\nThe answer is: The source domains are represented by the abbreviations D, E, K, B in the table which likely stand for different product categories. The target domains are also represented by the abbreviations D, E, K, B. Without further context, the exact meaning of D, E, K, and B cannot be determined, but they represent different categories or types of data used in the analysis.", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure3-1.png", "12-Table4-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "9-Table2-1.png", "8-Figure2-1.png", "15-Table7-1.png", "14-Table6-1.png", "11-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png", "11-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Book, electronics, beauty, music, IMDB, Yelp, cell phone, baby, DVDs, kitchen"}}
