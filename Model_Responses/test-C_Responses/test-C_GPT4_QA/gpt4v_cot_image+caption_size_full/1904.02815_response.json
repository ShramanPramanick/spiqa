They focus on model architecture, accuracy metrics, corpus statistics, and confusion matrix, but none of these explicitly mention a manual evaluation process. To determine whether manual evaluation was performed, one would typically need to review the methodology section of the related paper or report.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
