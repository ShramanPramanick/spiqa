These tasks help share common features or representations, which can improve the performance of each individual task.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "5-Figure4-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "Multitask learning is used for the task of predicting relevance of a comment on a different question to a given question, where the supplemental tasks are predicting relevance between the questions, and between the comment and the corresponding question"}, "195": {"question": "How much performance gap between their approach and the strong handcrafted method?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Image 3 presents data directly comparing different models on the same tasks, which allows us to assess the performance gap between them.'}\n\nGiven the data provided, it's not entirely clear what constitutes the \"strong handcrafted method\" as the images don't specifically indicate which method is handcrafted. However, based on the context suggesting that attention and IR (Information Retrieval) methods are being compared, I would interpret the handcrafted method most likely as the \"IR\" model without attention.\n\nThe answer is: \nFor Task A, the performance gap between the \"Attention & IR\" approach", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "5-Figure3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table4-1.png"], "answer": "0.007 MAP on Task A, 0.032 MAP on Task B, 0.055 MAP on Task C"}}
