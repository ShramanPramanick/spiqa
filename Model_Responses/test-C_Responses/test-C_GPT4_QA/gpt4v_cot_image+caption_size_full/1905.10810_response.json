{"654": {"question": "What is the difference in performance between the interpretable system (e.g. vectors and cosine distance) and LSTM with ELMo system?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'This image provides a direct comparison of performance metrics for different methods, including LSTM-ELMo and Vector distance (interpretable system).'}\n\nThe answer is : The LSTM with ELMo system has higher accuracy (0.6818) compared to the vector distance method (0.3945), which could be considered an interpretable system using vectors and cosine distance. The table does not provide perplexity and loss (train and test) for the vector distance method, but the LSTM-ELMo system shows lower loss on both training (0.07) and test (0.38", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Accuracy of best interpretible system was 0.3945 while accuracy of LSTM-ELMo net was 0.6818."}}
