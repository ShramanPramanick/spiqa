{"921": {"question": "What is the McGurk effect?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 6, 'Rationale': 'Provides a direct visual representation and explanation of the McGurk effect'}\n\nThe answer is: The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that shows an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. It happens when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading the viewer to perceive a third sound that is a combination of both the auditory and visual inputs, rather than either of the components alone.", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "8-Table7-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "a perceptual illusion, where listening to a speech sound while watching a mouth pronounce a different sound changes how the audio is heard"}, "922": {"question": "What is the McGurk effect?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'Image 0 directly illustrates the concept of the McGurk effect with an example, which is exactly what is needed to explain the phenomenon.'}\n\nThe answer is: The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. It occurs when a sound (phoneme B) is heard in synchronization with the visual component (mouth movement for phoneme A) of another sound, leading the viewer to perceive a third sound (phoneme C \u2260 B).
