This is evident from Image 0, which shows that in some cases, training a model like BERT or GPT on an intermediate task (e.g., QQP or MNLI) before fine-tuning it on a target task can lead to lower performance on that target task compared to training on", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "6-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "12-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
