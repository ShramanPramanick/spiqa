{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'This image shows a practical example of a multilingual NMT model being trained on a dataset with multiple languages and highlights the concept of \"zero-shot MT,\" which is directly related to transfer learning in neural machine translation.'}\n\nThe answer is: Neural machine translation (NMT) models can learn a variety of transferable skills through the process of transfer learning, including the ability to generalize across languages, leverage shared linguistic features, and perform zero-shot translation when trained on multilingual datasets. They can develop language-invariant features which enable the translation between language pairs that were not explicitly shown during training", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
