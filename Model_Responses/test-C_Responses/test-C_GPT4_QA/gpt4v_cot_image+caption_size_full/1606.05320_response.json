These features can be quite interpretable in terms of state transitions and the likelihood of observing certain data points given those states. HMMs are known for their interpretability since the hidden states and their", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png"], "answer": "A continuous emission HMM uses the hidden states of a 2-layer LSTM as features and a discrete emission HMM uses data as features. \nThe interpretability of the model is shown in Figure 2.

They are particularly good at modeling sequences where the assumption of a finite set of discrete states is reasonable.

For example, on the Linux text data, the HMM with 10 states has a loglikelihood of -2.76, while an LSTM with 20 dimensions has a loglikelihood of -1.87, indicating a smaller gap than between an", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "With similar number of parameters, the log likelihood is about 0.1 lower for LSTMs across datasets. When the number of parameters in LSTMs is increased, their log likelihood is up to 0.7 lower."}}
