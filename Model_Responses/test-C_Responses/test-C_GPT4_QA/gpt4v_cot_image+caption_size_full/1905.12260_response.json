By grounding language in visual context, models can learn to generalize beyond text-based features and potentially improve performance on tasks such as translation, image description, and cross-modal retrieval.", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "performance is significantly degraded without pixel data"}}
