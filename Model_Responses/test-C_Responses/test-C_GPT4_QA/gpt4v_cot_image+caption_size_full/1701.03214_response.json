{"535": {"question": "How much improvement does their method get over the fine tuning baseline?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This image provides a direct comparison of BLEU-4 scores, including the scores for fine-tuning and multi-domain results which is necessary to determine the improvement their method gets.'}\n\nThe answer is: The improvement over the fine-tuning baseline can be calculated by comparing the \"Fine tuning\" average score of 16.41 with the \"Multi domain + fine tuning\" average score of 15.82. Therefore, it seems that the method did not improve over the fine-tuning baseline; instead, there is a slight decrease of approximately 0.59 points in BLEU-", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "0.08 points on the 2011 test set, 0.44 points on the 2012 test set, 0.42 points on the 2013 test set for IWSLT-CE."}}
