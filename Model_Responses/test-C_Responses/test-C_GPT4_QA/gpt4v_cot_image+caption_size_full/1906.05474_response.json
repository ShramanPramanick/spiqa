{"1363": {"question": "Could you tell me more about the metrics used for performance evaluation?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'It shows a table with specific performance metrics used for different tasks, which directly answers the question about performance evaluation metrics.'}\n\nThe answer is: The metrics used for performance evaluation in the context of this data include Pearson correlation coefficients for sentence similarity tasks, F1 scores for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction tasks, and accuracy for inference tasks. These metrics are standard for evaluating the performance of models on various natural language processing tasks, with Pearson correlation measuring the linear correlation between predicted and actual scores, the F1 score being a harmonic mean of precision and recall, and accuracy representing the", "all_figures_names": ["5-Table3-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "BLUE utilizes different metrics for each of the tasks: Pearson correlation coefficient, F-1 scores, micro-averaging, and accuracy"}}
