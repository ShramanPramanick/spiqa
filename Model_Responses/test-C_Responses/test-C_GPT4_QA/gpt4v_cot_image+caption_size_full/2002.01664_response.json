GhostVLAD improves upon the NetVLAD layer by introducing \"ghost clusters,\" which are used to collect noise and background information that do not contribute to the task at hand. This allows the network to focus more on relevant features, improving the performance of the model.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content."}, "100": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'The table lists various languages along with training and testing hours, which can be used to identify the Indian languages they experimented with.'}\n\nThe answer is: Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, and Malayalam.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam"}, "101": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'The table contains a list of languages with associated training and testing hours, which directly answers the question about the Indian languages experimented with.'}\n\nThe answer is: Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, and Malayalam.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali,  English and Assamese (in table, missing in text)"}}
