Communities that use highly specific language and whose discussions evolve rapidly (high dynamicity) show higher rates of user retention, indicating a strong community identity and engagement. Conversely, communities with more stable content over time may exhibit long-lasting but potentially less intensive engagement. These phenomena are exemplified in communities that revolve around specific interests, events, or cultural", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
