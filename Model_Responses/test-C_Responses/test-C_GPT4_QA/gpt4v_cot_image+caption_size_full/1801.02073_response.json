However, it does provide detailed comparisons between different corpora, including information on their source, year, and various statistics. To determine the exact methodology, one would need more explicit information on the data collection and preparation methods.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}, "1003": {"question": "How many question types do they find in the datasets analyzed?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'This bar graph shows the distribution of question types, which is directly related to the question asked.'}\n\nThe answer is: seven question types.", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "7"}, "1004": {"question": "How do they analyze contextual similaries across datasets?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Image': 2, 'Rationale': 'This image provides detailed comparisons of datasets based on overlapping words between question-answer pairs and other statistics, which are relevant for analyzing contextual similarities.'}\n\nThe answer is: To analyze contextual similarities across datasets, metrics such as the macro average percentage of overlapping words between question-answer pairs normalized by their lengths (\u2126q, \u2126a, \u2126f) are used.
