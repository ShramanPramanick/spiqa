{"543": {"question": "how is mitigation of gender bias evaluated?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'The table shows evaluation results for models, which is relevant for understanding how gender bias mitigation is measured.'}\n\nThe answer is: Mitigation of gender bias is evaluated using various metrics that measure the level of bias in language models or generated texts. The metrics can range from calculating the differences in probabilities or associations between gendered words and occupation terms, to more complex statistical measures that take into account various factors such as the frequency of gendered pronouns and occupation nouns in model outputs. The methods often involve comparing the biases in a baseline model to those in models that have undergone specific bias mitigation interventions", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1"}}
