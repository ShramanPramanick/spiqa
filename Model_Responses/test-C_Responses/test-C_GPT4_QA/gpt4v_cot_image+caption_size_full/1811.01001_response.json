{"947": {"question": "Are the unobserved samples from the same distribution as the training data?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Image': 7, 'Rationale': 'This image shows the performance of models with training data from different probability distributions, which is relevant for comparing the distribution of unobserved samples to the training data distribution.'}\n\nThe answer is: Without additional context or data about the unobserved samples, we cannot definitively determine whether they are from the same distribution as the training data. However, if the unobserved samples share characteristics with the distributions used in Image 7, we might infer potential similarities or differences based on the model's performance metrics depicted in the generalization graphs. To make a proper assessment, we would require access", "all_figures_names": ["8-Figure4-1.png", "10-Figure7-1.png", "9-Figure5-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "10-Figure6-1.png", "5-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure2-1.png", "7-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
