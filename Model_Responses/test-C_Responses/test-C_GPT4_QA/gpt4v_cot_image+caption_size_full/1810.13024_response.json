{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Provides a visual representation of a confusion network'}\n\nThe answer is: A confusion network, or lattice, in the context of speech recognition, is a representation of different possible transcribed outputs where multiple alternatives for a particular segment of speech are organized in a compact form. It contains nodes and directed edges, where nodes represent points in time and edges represent hypothesized words along with their probabilities. This allows for the possibility of multiple parallel paths through the network, each path representing a different potential transcript.", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
