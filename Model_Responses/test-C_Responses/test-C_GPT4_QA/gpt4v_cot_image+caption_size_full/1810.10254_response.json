{"1167": {"question": "What was their perplexity score?", "referred_figures_indices": [2, 0], "response": "{'Image': 0, 'Rationale': 'The table displays various perplexity scores, directly answering the question.'}\n\nThe answer is: The perplexity scores are varied, depending on the model and the data split (Dev/Test) they correspond to. For instance, RNNLM has perplexity scores of 178.35 (Dev) and 171.27 (Test) without syntax, while LSTM has 150.65 (Dev) and 153.06 (Test) without syntax or 147.44 (Dev) and 148.38 (Test) with syntax.
