{"448": {"question": "Is the model presented in the paper state of the art?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'Image 1 provides a comparison of F1 scores, which are indicative of model performance, across various models on benchmark datasets. This comparison is essential to determine if the model is state of the art.'}\n\nThe answer is: It depends on the metric used to evaluate the models. While 'Our Model' in Image 1 has higher F1 scores than several other models on certain metrics, it does not have the highest F1 score across all metrics when compared to other models. Therefore, 'Our Model' shows competitive performance but is not definitively the state of the art across all", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "No, supervised models perform better for this task."}}
