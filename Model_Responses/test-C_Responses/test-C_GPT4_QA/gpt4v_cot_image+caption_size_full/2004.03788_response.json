If we consider the \"payoffs\" column as a measure of improvement, it appears that as the game strategies are applied through the iterations (from initial 1 to 8), the payoffs for \u03b1 generally decrease while the payoffs for \u03b2", "all_figures_names": ["10-Table6-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "10-Table5-1.png", "9-Table3-1.png", "10-Table7-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "9-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["10-Table7-1.png"], "answer": "Their GTRS approach got an improvement of 3.89% compared to SVM and 27.91% compared to Pawlak."}}
