For Named Entity questions, the AS Reader (single model) achieves 80.5% accuracy on the validation set and 76.2% on the test set. The AS Reader (greedy ensemble) further improves the accuracy to 82.3% on the validation set and 78", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure1-1.png", "10-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Answer with content missing: (Table 2) Accuracy of best AS reader results including ensembles are 78.4 and 83.7 when trained on BookTest compared to 71.0 and 68.9 when trained on CBT for Named endity and Common noun respectively."}}
