{"750": {"question": "What approach performs better in experiments global latent or sequence of fine-grained latent variables?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Image': 1, 'Rationale': 'This image provides a comparative table of results, including the performance of global and sequence-based latent variable models (GVT and SVT), which is directly related to the question.'}\n\nThe answer is: Without specific metrics to compare, it is not possible to definitively say which approach performs better in general as it depends on the criteria of the experiment. However, looking at Image 1, GVT and SVT have similar performances on certain metrics with some slight variations. For example, SVT has a slightly higher KLD and Dist-1 score whereas GVT has a slightly higher", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "PPL: SVT\nDiversity: GVT\nEmbeddings Similarity: SVT\nHuman Evaluation: SVT"}}
