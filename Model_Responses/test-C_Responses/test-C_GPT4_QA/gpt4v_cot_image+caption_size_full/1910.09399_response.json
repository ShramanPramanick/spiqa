{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Image': 3, 'Rationale': 'Provides a categorization of GAN frameworks relevant to text-to-image synthesis, which directly corresponds to the question regarding GAN architecture for text-to-image synthesis.'}\n\nThe answer is: Typical GAN architectures for text-to-image synthesis can be grouped into four major categories according to their focus: Semantic Enhancement GANs (aiming to improve the semantic relevance of the generated images to the input text), Resolution Enhancement GANs (focusing on generating high-resolution images), Diversity Enhancement GANs (enhancing the variety of generated images), and Motion Enhancement GANs (introducing motion", "all_figures_names": ["18-Table1-1.png", "22-Figure12-1.png", "21-Figure11-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "10-Figure8-1.png", "21-Figure10-1.png", "9-Figure7-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
