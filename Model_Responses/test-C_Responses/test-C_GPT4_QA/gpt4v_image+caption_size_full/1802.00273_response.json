{"1461": {"question": "What neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': 'Neural machine translation models can learn to abstract the meaning of text from one language and generate equivalent semantic content in another language. They can be trained on a large corpus of bilingual or multilingual data with language flags to create dense vector representations that capture linguistic information across languages. These models use encoder-decoder structures with attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input during translation. The representations learned can form a continuous language space where related languages are mapped closely together, enabling the model to perform transfer learning. This capability allows for \"zero-shot\" translation between language pairs that the model has not been explicitly trained on, by leveraging", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Models"}}
