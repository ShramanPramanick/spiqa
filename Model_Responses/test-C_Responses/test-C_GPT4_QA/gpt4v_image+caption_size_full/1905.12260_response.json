The first image and its caption illustrate a model that constrains query (text) and image representations to be similar, which implies that the model is using visual grounding to match text queries with relevant images. The tables in images 1, 2, and 4 show various evaluation scores for different models on tasks like semantic similarity and document classification, with models utilizing visual grounding (like ImageVec) achieving some of the best results. The captions mention that these results are from \"our method,\" suggesting that", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "performance is significantly degraded without pixel data"}}
