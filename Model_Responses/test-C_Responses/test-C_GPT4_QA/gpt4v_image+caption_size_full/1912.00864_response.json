The typical metrics used for such evaluations are ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 scores. These scores reflect how close the generated text is to a reference text, with higher scores indicating better performance.\n\nBased on Image 0 (Caption 0) and Image 4 (Caption 4), which both provide performance metrics for the 'NAGM' and the baseline scores ('w/o ste'), we can calculate the differences in ROUGE-L and BLEU-4 for", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table4-1.png", "7-Table7-1.png", "6-Table6-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table6-1.png", "6-Table4-1.png", "7-Table7-1.png"], "answer": "For the Oshiete-goo dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, Trans, by 0.021, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.037.  For the nfL6 dataset, the NAGM model's ROUGE-L score is higher than the highest performing conventional model, CLSTM, by 0.028, and its BLEU-4 score is higher than the highest performing model CLSTM by 0.040. Human evaluation of the NAGM's generated outputs for the Oshiete-goo dataset had 47% ratings of (1), the highest rating, while CLSTM only received 21% ratings of (1). For the nfL6 dataset, the comparison of (1)'s was NAGM's 50% to CLSTM's 30%. "}}
