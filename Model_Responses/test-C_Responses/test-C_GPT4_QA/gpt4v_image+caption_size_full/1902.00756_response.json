{"1470": {"question": "So this paper turns unstructured text inputs to parameters that GNNs can read?", "referred_figures_indices": [5], "response": "{'Answer': 'Yes, based on the information provided in the images and captions, it seems the paper is about a method that converts unstructured text inputs into parameters that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can interpret. The images show precision-recall curves, hyper-parameter settings, examples of relation extraction from text, sample predictions, the overall architecture of the model, and results on different test sets, demonstrating that the method involves reading and processing text to output structured data that a GNN can use for tasks like relation extraction.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure3-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Yes"}}
