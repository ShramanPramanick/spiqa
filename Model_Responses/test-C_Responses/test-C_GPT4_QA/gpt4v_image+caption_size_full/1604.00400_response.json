More specifically, higher-order ROUGE variants, like ROUGE-3, tend to have stronger correlations with human judgments compared to lower-order variants, such as ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, as indicated by the higher Pearson (r), Spearman (\u03c1), and Kendall (\u03c4) correlation coefficients. Additionally, variants using query reformulation with keywords (KW) and noun phrases (NP), especially those with discounted variants of SERA (DIS), generally show stronger correlations than the standard ROUGE", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
