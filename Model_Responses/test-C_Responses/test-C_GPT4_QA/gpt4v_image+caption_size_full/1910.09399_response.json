{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': 'Typical GAN architectures for text-to-image synthesis can be categorized based on the enhancement they provide: Semantic Enhancement GANs focus on improving the relevance between the text and the generated images; Resolution Enhancement GANs aim at increasing the resolution and clarity of the generated images; Diversity Enhancement GANs seek to enhance the variety in the generated images; and Motion Enhancement GANs introduce motion and temporal dynamics into the synthesis process. Common approaches include using multiple discriminators or generators, hierarchical approaches with nested discriminators, and multi-stage generation processes, as well as implementing conditioning on text data to guide the image synthesis.
