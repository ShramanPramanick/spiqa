{"654": {"question": "What is the difference in performance between the interpretable system (e.g. vectors and cosine distance) and LSTM with ELMo system?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'The LSTM-ELMo net performs better in terms of accuracy and loss (train) compared to the vector distance method, indicating a superior performance. Specifically, the LSTM-ELMo net has an accuracy of 0.6818 compared to the vector distance accuracy of 0.3945, and it exhibits a lower training loss of 0.07 against the vector distance method, which does not report training loss. However, in terms of loss (test), the performance is comparable, with the LSTM-ELMo net having a test loss of 0.38 and the vector distance method presumably having a similar loss", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table2-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Accuracy of best interpretible system was 0.3945 while accuracy of LSTM-ELMo net was 0.6818."}}
