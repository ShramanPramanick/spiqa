{"950": {"question": "How close do clusters match to ground truth tone categories?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Answer': 'The clusters for Mandarin and Cantonese exhibit a degree of matching with the ground truth tone categories, but with some overlap and misclassification as evident from the cluster-tone frequency tables and NMI scores. The normalized mutual information (NMI) scores for the first syllable are 0.738 for Mandarin and 0.515 for Cantonese, indicating a better cluster-to-tone correspondence for Mandarin. Considering all syllables, the NMI scores drop to 0.641 for Mandarin and 0.464 for Cantonese, showing that the clustering is less accurate when all syllables are considered.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "NMI between cluster assignments and ground truth tones for all sylables is:\nMandarin: 0.641\nCantonese: 0.464"}}
