The diagrams in images 0 and 1 depict components of the model and their interactions, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, but they do not quantify the total number of layers in the UTCNN model. Therefore, the direct answer to the question about the number of layers in the UTCNN model is not provided in the images or their captions.\n\n{'Answer': 'Not provided in images or captions'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "9-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "eight layers"}, "422": {"question": "Did they collected the two datasets?", "referred_figures_indices": [4], "response": "{'Answer': 'Yes'}", "all_figures_names": ["9-Table4-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table1-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "No"}}
