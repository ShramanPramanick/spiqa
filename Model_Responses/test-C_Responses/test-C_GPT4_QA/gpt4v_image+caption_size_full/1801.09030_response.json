The tables indicate that the professional evaluations, automatic evaluation results, and ablation studies demonstrate better performance by the \"Proposal\" model over \"Multi-Label\" and \"Basic seq2seq\" across different metrics such as precision (P), recall (R), and F-score (F). The addition of coverage mechanism and soft loss function also seems to contribute to the performance improvement. Given these outcomes, they would have reason to think their approach was effective.'}", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "8-Table6-1.png", "7-Table5-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png", "7-Table4-1.png", "6-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["1-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They think it will help human TCM practitioners make prescriptions."}}
