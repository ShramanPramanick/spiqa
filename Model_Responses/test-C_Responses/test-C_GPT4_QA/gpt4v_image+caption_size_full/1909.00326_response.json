The F1 accuracy of these methods is captured in a table showing that Attribution tends to have a higher F1 score, indicating its effectiveness in detecting under-translation errors. Moreover, they use Attribution (integrated gradients) to calculate word importance and the contribution matrix, as shown in an example with English to French translation. They also analyze the distribution of syntactic categories, word fertility, and perform synthetic perturbation experiments to understand the impact of different types", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "11-Table6-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
