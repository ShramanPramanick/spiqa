Another method includes examining the context within which people are depicted in various images to observe if certain demographics are consistently portrayed in specific roles or settings that could imply bias.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Looking for adjectives marking the noun \"baby\" and also looking for most-common adjectives related to certain nouns using POS-tagging"}, "62": {"question": "What biases are found in the dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'The dataset appears to have biases related to race and ethnicity, based on the frequency of mention in descriptions. The provided table suggests that racial and ethnic descriptors are used disproportionately across different groups, with Asian identities being mentioned more frequently (average 60%), followed by Black (average 40%), and White (average 20%).
