According to Table 7 and Table 8 from the input images, the proposed embeddings generally perform worse than fastText, with lower cosine similarity scores in the case of word pairs related to countries and capitals, as well as other word relationships. Moreover, Table 9 demonstrates that SdfastText has a lower syntactic accuracy when compared using the WordSim-353 dataset for various window sizes. Overall, the Sindhi fastText word representations seem to outperform the proposed word embeddings in the criteria presented in the images.'", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure1-1.png", "15-Table8-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "11-Table4-1.png", "17-Figure6-1.png", "15-Table7-1.png", "16-Table9-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["15-Table7-1.png", "15-Table8-1.png"], "answer": "Proposed SG model vs SINDHI FASTTEXT:\nAverage cosine similarity score: 0.650 vs 0.388\nAverage semantic relatedness similarity score between countries and their capitals: 0.663 vs 0.391"}, "465": {"question": "How many uniue words are in the dataset?", "referred_figures_indices": [2], "response": "{'Answer': '908,456'}", "all_figures_names": ["15-Table7-1.png", "10-Table3-1.png", "8-Table2-1.png", "17-Figure4-1.png", "12-Figure3-1.png", "14-Table6-1.png", "9-Figure2-1.png", "16-Table9-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["8-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "908456 unique words are available in collected corpus."}}
