GCNs are particularly well-suited for data that can be represented as graphs, as they naturally leverage the connections and structure within the data. This makes them effective for tasks related to social network analysis, recommendation systems, and molecular structure analysis, where the data is inherently graph-structured.\n\nFurthermore, GCNs are often more efficient in terms of computational resources and training time when compared to models with attention mechanisms.
