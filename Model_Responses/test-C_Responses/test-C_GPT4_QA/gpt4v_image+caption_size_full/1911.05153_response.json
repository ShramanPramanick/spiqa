The strongest performance improvement using proposed methods is observed on the adversarial test sets, with the combination of adversarial logit and data augmentation (cs+es) leading to the highest accuracy of 41.3%.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "Data augmentation (es)  improved Adv es by 20% comparing to baseline \nData augmentation (cs) improved Adv cs by 16.5% comparing to baseline\nData augmentation (cs+es) improved both Adv cs and Adv es by at least 10% comparing to baseline \nAll models show improvements over adversarial sets  \n"}}
