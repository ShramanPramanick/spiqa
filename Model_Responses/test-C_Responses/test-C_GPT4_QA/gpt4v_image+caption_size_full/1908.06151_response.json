Image 1 and its caption indicate that decreasing the depth of the encoders (and hence using a smaller amount of layers) from a 6-6-4 configuration to a 6-4-6 configuration resulted in lower BLEU scores and higher TER scores, which are indicative of reduced translation quality. Specifically, for the test2016 and test2017 data sets, the BLEU score dropped and the TER score increased when the encoder's number of layers was reduced.'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table2-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "comparing to the results from reducing the number of layers in the decoder, the BLEU score was 69.93 which is less than 1% in case of test2016 and in case of test2017 it was less by 0.2 %.
