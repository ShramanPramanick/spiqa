Specific methods such as semantic coherence, exclusivity analysis, and optimal model search are employed to determine the most relevant topics and the number of topics to include in the analysis. These techniques help to identify the underlying structure of the topics discussed in the documents by clustering similar words and assessing the quality and distinctiveness of each topic.
