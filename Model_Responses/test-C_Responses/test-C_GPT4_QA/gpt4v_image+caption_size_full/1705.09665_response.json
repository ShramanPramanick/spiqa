Dynamic communities see higher user retention rates and longer user tenures, indicating that users stay engaged with content that changes frequently. Meanwhile, distinctive communities, which use a highly specific language set that differentiates them from other communities, tend to demonstrate a larger linguistic acculturation gap; this signifies that established members adopt the community's unique language more than newcomers. Examples of dynamic communities include \"CollegeBasketball\" and \"formula1,\" whereas \"Cooking\" and \"Guitar\" are", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
