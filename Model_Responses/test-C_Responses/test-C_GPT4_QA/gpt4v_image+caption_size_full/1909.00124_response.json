According to Figure 2, its accuracy on clean test data is better than the CNN model, particularly as the noise rate increases, which is evident in environments such as Movie, Laptop, and Restaurant reviews. The Table 2 data also confirms the effective performance of NETAB, outperforming other listed methods, including the traditional CNN and various noise adaptation approaches, in terms of accuracy (ACC) and F1 scores for both positive and negative classes across all three domains (Movie, Laptop, Restaurant).
