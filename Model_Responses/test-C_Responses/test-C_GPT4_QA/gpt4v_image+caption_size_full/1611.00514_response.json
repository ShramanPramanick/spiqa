Table 2 indicates that the Equal Error Rate (EER) ranges from 14.70% to 17.87% depending on the scenario and acoustic features used. The lowest EER (14.70%) is achieved in Scenario B with unequaled conditions using the fusion of MFCC and PLP features, which implies that the system is more effective in that scenario. Additionally, the lowest minimum decision cost function (C_det min) is 0.6012, which occurred in the primary condition using the fusion method.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "6-Table3-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "1-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "EER 16.04, Cmindet 0.6012, Cdet 0.6107"}}
