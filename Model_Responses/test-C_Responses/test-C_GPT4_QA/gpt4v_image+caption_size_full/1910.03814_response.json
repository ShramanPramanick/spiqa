This is evident from the Precision vs Recall and ROC curve plots which show that models with multimodal inputs (FCM-ALL, TKM-All, SCM-All) generally outperform the unimodal model (FCM-I) and the baseline LSTM model that uses only text. The performance metrics in Table 1 also support this: the FCM model with TT, IT, I inputs has a higher F-measure, AUC, and ACC compared to the versions with fewer inputs, indicating that", "all_figures_names": ["7-Figure6-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "7-Figure7-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Figure6-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Unimodal LSTM vs Best Multimodal (FCM)\n- F score: 0.703 vs 0.704\n- AUC: 0.732 vs 0.734 \n- Mean Accuracy: 68.3 vs 68.4 "}}
