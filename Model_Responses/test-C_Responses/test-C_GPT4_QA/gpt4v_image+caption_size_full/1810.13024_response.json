{"948": {"question": "What is a confusion network or lattice?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'A confusion network, also referred to as a CN, is a type of data structure often used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) to represent multiple possible interpretations of a spoken phrase or sentence. It arranges the alternative hypotheses into a compact form, wherein each arc or edge in the network corresponds to a word or a set of alternative words that are likely candidates at that position in the recognized sequence. Confusion networks are derived from word lattices, which are graphs that show all possible paths through a model that match the input data. A lattice provides a full search space, while a confusion network is a condensed representation", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure3-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
