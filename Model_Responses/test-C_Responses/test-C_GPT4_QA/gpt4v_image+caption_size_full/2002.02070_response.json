However, examining car reviews (as in Image 2 and 3) and the attributes of cars often spoken about (as in Image 1), it is clear that the way features and attributes are described using words is essential for conveying specific meanings. Therefore, in general linguistic terms, the order of words can influence the meaning and clarity of communication, which likely applies to \"car speak\" as well. For example, saying \"luxurious comfortable cabin seats\" conveys a different emphasis than \"comfortable luxurious", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table2-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "2-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "No"}, "410": {"question": "What is the performance of classifiers?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'Based on the data from Image 0, KNN has the highest F1 Micro score at 0.6762, while RF has the lowest F1 Micro score at 0.6687.
