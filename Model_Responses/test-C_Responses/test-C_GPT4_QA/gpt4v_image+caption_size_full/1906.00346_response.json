The performance metrics shown in Table 3 indicate that the G-BERT model is competitive with other methods for the Medication Recommendation Task, suggesting that its method of incorporating ontology embeddings and BERT for prediction could be adapted for similar tasks requiring hierarchical and sequential data processing.
