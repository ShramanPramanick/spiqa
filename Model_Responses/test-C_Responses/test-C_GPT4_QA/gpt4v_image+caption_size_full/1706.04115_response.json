In the context of a slot-filling task, the question templates are used to extract specific pieces of information (slots) from a given text, where each slot corresponds to a type of information that is relevant to a particular relation. For example, using the relation \"educated_at\" and the corresponding question templates like \"Where did X graduate from?\" or \"In which university did X study?\", the task would be to fill in the \"educated_at\" slot with the appropriate educational institution associated with the entity \"", "all_figures_names": ["8-Table4-1.png", "7-Table3-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "7-Figure4-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "8-Figure5-1.png", "7-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["1-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "The relation R(x,y) is mapped onto a question q whose answer is y"}}
