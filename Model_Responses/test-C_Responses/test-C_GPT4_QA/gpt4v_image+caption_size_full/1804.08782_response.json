According to Image 0 and its caption, a t-SNE plot illustrates the distribution of encoded turn-level embeddings for therapy sessions that have been characterized as having low versus high emotional bonds, suggesting an approach to visualize how emotional bond levels might be distributed in a transformed feature space. Image 1 and its caption indicate that when compared to other baseline measures, NED has a high classification accuracy in distinguishing real versus fake therapy sessions in both Fisher corpus and Suicide corpus datasets.
