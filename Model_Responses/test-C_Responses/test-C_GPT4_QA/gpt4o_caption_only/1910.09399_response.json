{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Answer': 'The typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synthesis group involves a feature embedding function to convert text into feature vectors, a generator that creates images using a latent vector and text features, and a discriminator that evaluates the generated images based on both the synthetic image and text information. Advanced frameworks are categorized into Semantic Enhancement GANs, Resolution Enhancement GANs, Diversity Enhancement GANs, and Motion Enhancement GAGs, and they may use various configurations such as multiple discriminators, multi-stage GANs, symmetric training of discriminators and generators, or hierarchical discriminators.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure3-1.png", "21-Figure11-1.png", "20-Table2-1.png", "18-Table1-1.png", "22-Figure12-1.png", "7-Figure5-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "10-Figure8-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
