{"18": {"question": "How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'Various social phenomena such as dynamicity, distinctiveness, acculturation gap, and user retention manifest differently in various types of communities. Dynamic communities show higher user retention rates and substantial acculturation gaps, meaning long-term users integrate deeply into the community's language. Distinctive communities also exhibit larger acculturation gaps, marking a clear differentiation between long-term users and outsiders. Additionally, different communities use specific and temporally volatile language related to their themes, influencing their perceived dynamicity and distinctiveness.'}", "all_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
