They also use contribution matrices calculated by Attribution (integrated gradients) on translation tasks (as shown in Figure 1) and distributions of word fertility based on attribution importance and word count (as shown in Table 4).'}", "all_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png", "6-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "11-Table5-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png", "8-Table4-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["7-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "They measured the under-translated words with low word importance score as calculated by Attribution.\nmethod"}}
