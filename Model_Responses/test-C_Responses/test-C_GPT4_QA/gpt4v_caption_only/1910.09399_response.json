{"159": {"question": "What is typical GAN architecture for each text-to-image synhesis group?", "referred_figures_indices": [6], "response": "{'Answer': 'Typical GAN architecture for text-to-image synthesis includes a generator that creates synthetic images from a latent vector and text features, and a discriminator that predicts whether the generated image is real or fake based on the text information. There are variations such as use of multiple discriminators, multiple stage GANs, progressively trained symmetric discriminators and generators, and single-stream generators with hierarchically-nested discriminators. These can be categorized into Semantic Enhancement GANs, Resolution Enhancement GANs, Diversity Enhancement GANs, and Motion Enhancement GANs.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Figure4-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png", "21-Figure10-1.png", "3-Figure2-1.png", "8-Figure6-1.png", "10-Figure8-1.png", "12-Figure9-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["12-Figure9-1.png"], "answer": "Semantic Enhancement GANs: DC-GANs, MC-GAN\nResolution Enhancement GANs: StackGANs, AttnGAN, HDGAN\nDiversity Enhancement GANs: AC-GAN, TAC-GAN etc.\nMotion Enhancement GAGs: T2S, T2V, StoryGAN"}}
