Dynamic and distinctive communities show higher rates of user retention and average tenure, with distinctions further driving variation across generic and distinctive categories. Communities with higher dynamicity generally exhibit lower acculturation gaps, whereas higher distinctiveness results in the opposite trend.'\n}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table1-1.png", "5-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure1-1.png", "6-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "Dynamic communities have substantially higher rates of monthly user retention than more stable communities. More distinctive communities exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities. There is also a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community - a short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content.\n"}}
