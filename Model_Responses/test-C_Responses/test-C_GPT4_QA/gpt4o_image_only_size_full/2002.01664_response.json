It enhances NetVLAD by introducing ghost clusters that help in capturing more diverse patterns in data, leading to better discrimination and higher accuracy. This is evident from its high F1-Score of 98.43%, as shown in the comparison with other methods and pooling techniques.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png"], "answer": "An extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content."}, "100": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [3], "response": "{'Answer': 'Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, English'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Hindi, English, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and Malayalam"}, "101": {"question": "Which 7 Indian languages do they experiment with?", "referred_figures_indices": [1], "response": "{'Answer': 'Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, English'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png", "4-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali,  English and Assamese (in table, missing in text)"}}
