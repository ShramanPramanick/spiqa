Here are the details:\n\n1. **Metrics Used:**\n   - Pearson: Used for evaluating sentence similarity tasks in datasets like MedSTS and BIOSSES.\n   - F1 Score (F): Applied to Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, document classification, and some relation extraction tasks. Specific datasets include BC5CDR-disease, BC5CDR-chemical, ShARe/CLEFE, DDI, and HoC.\n   - Micro F1 Score: Used for evaluating relation extraction tasks in", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table2-1.png", "5-Table3-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "BLUE utilizes different metrics for each of the tasks: Pearson correlation coefficient, F-1 scores, micro-averaging, and accuracy"}}
