For example, the performance improves substantially when moving from less complex models to more complex ones with more layers, as seen in the comparison between the different setups in the provided tables.'}", "all_figures_names": ["3-Figure1-1.png", "7-Table2-1.png", "6-Table1-1.png", "8-Table3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["6-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "comparing to the results from reducing the number of layers in the decoder, the BLEU score was 69.93 which is less than 1% in case of test2016 and in case of test2017 it was less by 0.2 %.
