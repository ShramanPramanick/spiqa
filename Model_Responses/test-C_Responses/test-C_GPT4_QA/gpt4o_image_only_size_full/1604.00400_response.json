ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-3 generally have higher correlations compared to ROUGE-1. For instance, ROUGE-2-F has Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations of 0.816, 0.696, and 0.552 respectively, while ROUGE-3-F has 0.878, 0.841,", "all_figures_names": ["6-Table3-1.png", "7-Figure1-1.png", "5-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["5-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Using Pearson corelation measure,  for example, ROUGE-1-P is 0.257 and ROUGE-3-F 0.878."}}
