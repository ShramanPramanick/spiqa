It allows for the encoding of alternative word choices and their respective probabilities, facilitating tasks like speech recognition and machine translation by considering various potential pathways for decoding.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Table4-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "4-Table5-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "4-Table3-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "graph-like structures where arcs connect nodes representing multiple hypothesized words, thus allowing multiple incoming arcs unlike 1-best sequences"}}
