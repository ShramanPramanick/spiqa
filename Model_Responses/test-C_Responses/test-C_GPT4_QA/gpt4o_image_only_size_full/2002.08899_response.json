Damaging LSTMs generally negatively impacts the metrics, whereas damaging the Lexicon Unit results in mixed effects. In Colors, LSTMs and Lexicon Unit damages are relatively robust, maintaining a precision of 95 and 90, respectively. In GEO, damaging LSTMs increases precision significantly to 99.09, while damaging the Lexicon Unit leads to a slight decrease.
