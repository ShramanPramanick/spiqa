These models include layers such as dropout, convolutional layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and make predictions on the singer's identity and pitch. The evaluation metrics include naturalness, similarity, and NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation) scores, as shown by the comparison of methods like USVC and PitchNet.'}", "all_figures_names": ["2-Figure2-1.png", "4-Figure3-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png", "2-Figure1-1.png", "3-Table1-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Automatic: Normalized cross correlation (NCC)\nManual: Mean Opinion Score (MOS)"}}
