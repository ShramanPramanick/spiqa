For Mandarin, clusters B, C, and D correspond closely to tones T1, T3, and T4 respectively. For Cantonese, clusters A and B and C show correspondence primarily with tones T1, T2, and partially T3, T5, and T6, although there is some spread and overlap in categories.'}", "all_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png", "1-Figure1-1.png", "4-Table2-1.png", "4-Table1-1.png", "2-Figure2-1.png", "3-Figure3-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "NMI between cluster assignments and ground truth tones for all sylables is:\nMandarin: 0.641\nCantonese: 0.464"}}
