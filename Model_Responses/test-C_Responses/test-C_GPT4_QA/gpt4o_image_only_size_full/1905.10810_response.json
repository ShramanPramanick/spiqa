{"654": {"question": "What is the difference in performance between the interpretable system (e.g. vectors and cosine distance) and LSTM with ELMo system?", "referred_figures_indices": [0], "response": "{'Answer': 'The interpretable system (vector distance) has an accuracy of 0.3945, while the LSTM-ELMo system has a higher accuracy of 0.6818. The LSTM-ELMo system also has a lower train loss (0.07) compared to the interpretable system, though the test loss for the LSTM-ELMo system is slightly higher (0.38) than the LSTM-2 net (0.37). Perplexity values are only available for the LSTM systems, with the LSTM-ELMo net showing a much higher perplexity (706166", "all_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png", "3-Table2-1.png"], "referred_figures_names": ["3-Table1-1.png"], "answer": "Accuracy of best interpretible system was 0.3945 while accuracy of LSTM-ELMo net was 0.6818."}}
